<br>
SURA 2. AL-BAQARA (THE COW)<br>
1. Alif. Lam. Mim.<br>
2. This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt, a guidance unto those who<br>
ward off [evil].<br>
3. Who believe in the Unseen, and establish worship, and spend of that We have<br>
bestowed upon them;<br>
4. And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee [Muhammad] and that which<br>
was revealed before thee, and are certain of the Hereafter.<br>
5. These depend on guidance from their Lord. These are the successful.<br>
6. As for the Disbelievers, Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is<br>
all one for them; they believe not.<br>
7. Allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts, and on their eyes there is<br>
a covering. Theirs will be an awful doom.<br>
8. And of mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, when<br>
they believe not.<br>
9. They think to beguile Allah and those who believe, and they beguile none save<br>
themselves; but they perceive not.<br>
10. In their hearts is a disease, and Allah increaseth their disease. A painful<br>
doom is theirs because they lie.<br>
11. And when it is said unto them: Make not mischief in the earth, they say: We<br>
are peacemakers only.<br>
12. Are not they indeed the mischief-makers? But they perceive not.<br>
13. And when it is said unto them: believe as the people believe, they say:<br>
shall we believe as the foolish believe? are not they indeed the foolish? But<br>
they know not.<br>
14. And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe; but when<br>
they go apart to their devils they declare: Lo! we are with you; verily we did<br>
but mock.<br>
15. Allah [Himself] doth mock them, leaving them to wander blindly on in their<br>
contumacy.<br>
<br>
To Do List<br>
<br>
1. Find references with punishment for Apostasy and abolish them.<br>
2. Explicitly allow Apostasy.<br>
3. 10.000 things and more. ;)<br>
<br>
1<br>
<br>
16. These are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, so their<br>
commerce doth not prosper, neither are they guided.<br>
17. Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire, and when it<br>
sheddeth its light around him Allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in<br>
darkness, where they cannot see,<br>
18. Deaf, dumb and blind; and they return not.<br>
19. Or like a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder and the flash<br>
of lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears by reason of the thunderclaps, for fear of death, Allah encompasseth the disbelievers [in His guidance,<br>
His omniscience and His omnipotence].<br>
20. The lightning almost snatcheth away their sight from them. As often as it<br>
flasheth forth for them they walk therein, and when it darkeneth against them<br>
they stand still. If Allah willed, He could destroy their hearing and their<br>
sight. Lo! Allah is able to do all things.<br>
21. O mankind! worship your Lord, Who hath created you and those before you, so<br>
that ye may ward off [evil].<br>
22. Who hath appointed the earth a resting-place for you, and the sky a canopy;<br>
and causeth water to pour down from the sky, thereby producing fruits as food<br>
for you. And do not set up rivals to Allah when ye know [better].<br>
23. And if ye are in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto Our slave<br>
[Muhammad], then produce a surah of the like thereof, and call your witness<br>
beside Allah if ye are truthful.<br>
24. And if ye do it not - and ye can never do it - then guard yourselves against<br>
the Fire prepared for disbelievers, whose fuel is of men and stones.<br>
25. And give glad tidings [O Muhammad] unto those who believe and do good works;<br>
that theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow; as often as they are<br>
regaled with food of the fruit thereof, they say: this is what was given us<br>
aforetime; and it is given to them in resemblance. There for them are pure<br>
companions; there for ever they abide.<br>
26. Lo! Allah disdaineth not to coin the similitude even of a gnat. Those who<br>
believe know that it is the truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve say:<br>
What doth Allah wish [to teach] by such a similitude? He misleadeth many<br>
thereby, and He guideth many thereby; and He misleadeth thereby only miscreants;<br>
27. Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever that<br>
which Allah ordered to be joined, and [who] make mischief in the earth: Those<br>
are they who are the losers.<br>
28. How disbelieve ye in Allah when ye were dead and He gave life to you! Then<br>
He will give you death, then life again, and then unto Him ye will return.<br>
29. He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth. Then turned He to the<br>
heaven, and fashioned it as seven heavens. And He is knower of all things.<br>
30. And when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am about to place a viceroy in<br>
the earth, they said: Wilt thou place therein one who will do harm therein and<br>
will shed blood, while we, we hymn Thy praise and sanctify Thee? He said: Surely<br>
I know that which ye know not.<br>
31. And He taught Adam all the names, then showed them to the angels, saying:<br>
Inform Me of the names of these, if ye are truthful.<br>
32. They said: Be glorified! We have no knowledge saving that which Thou hast<br>
taught us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower, the Wise.<br>
<br>
2<br>
<br>
33. He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names, and when he had informed them<br>
of their names, He said: Did I not tell you that I know the secret of the<br>
heavens and the earth? And I know that which ye disclose and which ye hide.<br>
34. And when We said unto the angels: Prostrate yourselves before Adam, they<br>
fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He demurred through pride, and so became a<br>
disbeliever.<br>
35. And We said: O Adam! Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat ye<br>
freely [of the fruits] thereof where ye will; but come not nigh this tree lest<br>
ye become wrong-doers.<br>
36. But Satan caused them to deflect therefrom and expelled them from the<br>
[happy] state in which they were; and We said: Fall down, one of you a foe unto<br>
the other! There shall be for you on earth a habitation and provision for a<br>
time.<br>
37. Then Adam received from his Lord words [of revelation], and He relented<br>
toward him. Lo! He is the relenting, the Merciful.<br>
38. We said: Go down, all of you, from hence; but verily there cometh unto you<br>
from Me a guidance; and whoso followeth My guidance, there shall no fear come<br>
upon them neither shall they grieve.<br>
39. But they who disbelieve, and deny Our revelations, such are rightful Peoples<br>
of the Fire. They will abide therein.<br>
40. O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you, and<br>
fulfil your [part of the] covenant, I shall fulfil My [part of the] covenant,<br>
and fear Me.<br>
41. And believe in that which I reveal, confirming that which ye possess already<br>
[of the Scripture], and be not first to disbelieve therein, and part not with My<br>
revelations for a trifling price, and keep your duty unto Me.<br>
42. Confound not truth with falsehood, nor knowingly conceal the truth.<br>
43. Establish worship, pay the poor-due, and bow your heads with those who bow<br>
[in worship].<br>
44. Enjoin ye righteousness upon mankind while ye yourselves forget [to practise<br>
it]? And ye are readers of the Scripture! Have ye then no sense?<br>
45. Seek help in patience and prayer; and truly it is hard save for the humbleminded,<br>
46. Who know that they will have to meet their Lord, and that unto Him they are<br>
returning.<br>
47. O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and how I<br>
preferred you to [all] creatures.<br>
48. And guard yourselves against a day when no soul will in aught avail another,<br>
nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be received<br>
from it, nor will they be helped.<br>
49. And [remember] when We did deliver you from Pharaoh's folk, who were<br>
afflicting you with dreadful torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women:<br>
that was a tremendous trial from your Lord.<br>
50. And when We brought you through the sea and rescued you, and drowned the<br>
folk of Pharaoh in your sight.<br>
51. And when We did appoint for Moses forty nights [of solitude], and then ye<br>
chose the calf, when he had gone from you, and were wrong-doers.<br>
<br>
3<br>
<br>
52. Then, even after that, We pardoned you in order that ye might give thanks.<br>
53. And when We gave unto Moses the Scripture and the criterion [of right and<br>
wrong], that ye might be led aright.<br>
54. And when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Ye have wronged yourselves<br>
by your choosing of the calf [for worship] so turn in penitence to your Creator,<br>
and kill [the guilty] yourselves. That will be best for you with your Creator<br>
and He will relent toward you. Lo! He is the Relenting, the Merciful.<br>
55. And when ye said: O Moses! We will not believe in thee till we see Allah<br>
plainly; and even while ye gazed the lightning seized you.<br>
56. Then We revived you after your extinction, that ye might give thanks.<br>
57. And We caused the white cloud to overshadow you and sent down on you the<br>
manna and the quails, [saying]: Eat of the good things wherewith We have<br>
provided you - they wronged Us not, but they did wrong themselves.<br>
58. And when We said: Go into this township and eat freely of that which is<br>
therein, and enter the gate prostrate, and say: "Repentance." We will forgive<br>
you your sins and will increase [reward] for the right-doers.<br>
59. But those who did wrong changed the word which had been told them for<br>
another saying, and We sent down upon the evil-doers wrath from heaven for their<br>
evil-doing.<br>
60. And when Moses asked for water for his people, We said: Smite with thy staff<br>
the rock. And there gushed out therefrom twelve springs [so that] each tribe<br>
knew their drinking-place. Eat and drink of that which Allah hath provided, and<br>
do not act corruptly, making mischief in the earth.<br>
61. And when ye said: O Moses! We are weary of one kind of food; so call upon<br>
thy Lord for us that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth - of<br>
its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its onions. He<br>
said: Would ye exchange that which is higher for that which is lower? Go down to<br>
settled country, thus ye shall get that which ye demand. And humiliation and<br>
wretchedness were stamped upon them and they were visited with wrath from Allah.<br>
That was because they disbelieved in Allah's revelations and slew the prophets<br>
wrongfully. That was for their disobedience and transgression.<br>
62. Lo! Those who believe [in that which is revealed unto thee, Muhammad], and<br>
those who are Jews, and Christians, and Sabaeans - whoever believeth in Allah<br>
and the Last Day and doeth right - surely their reward is with their Lord, and<br>
there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.<br>
63. And [remember, O Children of Israel] when We made a covenant with you and<br>
caused the mount to tower above you, [saying]: Hold fast that which We have<br>
given you, and remember that which is therein, that ye may ward off [evil].<br>
64. Then, even after that, ye turned away, and if it had not been for the grace<br>
of Allah and His mercy ye had been among the losers.<br>
65. And ye know of those of you who broke the Sabbath, how We said unto them: Be<br>
ye apes, despised and hated!<br>
66. And We made it an example to their own and to succeeding generations, and an<br>
admonition to the Allah-fearing.<br>
67. And when Moses said unto his people: Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye<br>
sacrifice a cow, they said: Dost thou make game of us? He answered: Allah forbid<br>
that I should be among the foolish!<br>
<br>
4<br>
<br>
68. They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what [cow] she<br>
is. [Moses] answered: Lo! He saith, Verily she is a cow neither with calf nor<br>
immature; [she is] between the two conditions; so do that which ye are<br>
commanded.<br>
69. They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us of what colour<br>
she is. [Moses] answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a yellow cow. Bright is<br>
her colour, gladdening beholders.<br>
70. They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what [cow] she<br>
is. Lo! cows are much alike to us; and Lo! if Allah wills, we may be led aright.<br>
71. [Moses] answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a cow unyoked; she plougheth<br>
not the soil nor watereth the tilth; whole and without mark. They said: Now thou<br>
bringest the truth. So they sacrificed her, though almost they did not.<br>
72. And [remember] when ye slew a man and disagreed concerning it and Allah<br>
brought forth that which ye were hiding.<br>
73. And We said: Smite him with some of it. Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life<br>
and showeth you His portents so that ye may understand.<br>
74. Then, even after that, your hearts were hardened<br>
worse than rocks, for hardness. For indeed there are<br>
gush, and indeed there are rocks which split asunder<br>
them. And indeed there are rocks which fall down for<br>
not unaware of what ye do.<br>
<br>
and became as rocks, or<br>
rocks from out which rivers<br>
so that water floweth from<br>
the fear of Allah. Allah is<br>
<br>
75. Have ye any hope that they will be true to you when a party of them used to<br>
listen to the word of Allah, then used to change it, after they had understood<br>
it, knowingly?<br>
76. And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe. But when<br>
they go apart one with another they say: Prate ye to them of that which Allah<br>
hath disclosed to you that they may contend with you before your Lord concerning<br>
it? Have ye then no sense?<br>
77. Are they then unaware that Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and<br>
that which they proclaim?<br>
78. Among them are unlettered folk who know the Scripture not except from<br>
hearsay. They but guess.<br>
79. Therefore woe be unto those who write the Scripture with their hands and<br>
then say, "This is from Allah," that they may purchase a small gain therewith.<br>
Woe unto them for that their hands have written, and woe unto them for that they<br>
earn thereby.<br>
80. And they say: The Fire [of punishment] will not touch us save for a certain<br>
number of days. Say: Have ye received a covenant from Allah - truly Allah will<br>
not break His covenant - or tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not?<br>
81. Nay, but whosoever hath done evil and his sin surroundeth him; such are<br>
rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein.<br>
82. And those who believe and do good works: such are rightful owners of the<br>
Garden. They will abide therein.<br>
83. And [remember] when We made a<br>
[saying]: Worship none save Allah<br>
and to orphans and the needy, and<br>
and pay the poor-due. Then, after<br>
averse.<br>
<br>
covenant with the Children of Israel,<br>
[only], and be good to parents and to kindred<br>
speak kindly to mankind; and establish worship<br>
that, ye slid back, save a few of you, being<br>
<br>
5<br>
<br>
84. And when We made with you a covenant [saying]: Shed not the blood of your<br>
people nor turn [a party of] your people out of your dwellings. Then ye ratified<br>
[Our covenant] and ye were witnesses [thereto].<br>
85. Yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out a party of your people from<br>
their homes, supporting one another against them by sin and transgression? - and<br>
if they came to you as captives ye would ransom them, whereas their expulsion<br>
was itself unlawful for you - Believe ye in part of the Scripture and disbelieve<br>
ye in part thereof? And what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in<br>
the life of the world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to<br>
the most grievous doom. For Allah is not unaware of what ye do.<br>
86. Such are those who buy the life of the world at the price of the Hereafter.<br>
Their punishment will not be lightened, neither will they have support.<br>
87. And verily We gave unto Moses the Scripture and We caused a train of<br>
messengers to follow after him, and We gave unto Jesus, son of Mary, clear<br>
proofs [of Allah's sovereignty], and We supported him with the Holy spirit. Is<br>
it ever so, that, when there cometh unto you a messenger [from Allah] with that<br>
which ye yourselves desire not, ye grow arrogant, and some ye disbelieve and<br>
some ye slay?<br>
88. And they say: Our hearts are hardened. Nay, but Allah hath cursed them for<br>
their unbelief. Little is that which they believe.<br>
89. And when there cometh unto them a scripture from Allah, confirming that in<br>
their possession - though before that they were asking for a signal triumph over<br>
those who disbelieved - and when there cometh unto them that which they know [to<br>
be the truth] they disbelieve therein. The curse of Allah is on disbelievers.<br>
90. Evil is that for which they sell their souls: that they should disbelieve in<br>
that which Allah hath revealed, grudging that Allah should reveal of His bounty<br>
unto whom He will of His slaves. They have incurred anger upon anger. For<br>
disbelievers is a shameful doom.<br>
91. And when it is said unto them: Believe in that which Allah hath revealed,<br>
they say: We believe in that which was revealed unto us. And they disbelieve in<br>
that which cometh after it, though it is the truth confirming that which they<br>
possess. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Why then slew ye the prophets of Allah<br>
aforetime, if ye are [indeed] believers?<br>
92. And Moses came unto you with clear proofs [of Allah's Sovereignty], yet,<br>
while he was away, ye chose the calf [for worship] and ye were wrong-doers.<br>
93. And when We made with you a covenant and caused the Mount to tower above<br>
you, [saying]: Hold fast by that which We have given you, and hear [Our Word],<br>
they said: We hear and we rebel. And [worship of] the calf was made to sink into<br>
their hearts because of their rejection [of the covenant]. Say [unto them]: Evil<br>
is that which your belief enjoineth on you, if ye are believers.<br>
94. Say [unto them]: If the abode of the Hereafter in the providence of Allah is<br>
indeed for you alone and not for others of mankind [as ye pretend], then long<br>
for death [for ye must long for death] if ye are truthful.<br>
95. But they will never long for it, because of that which their own hands have<br>
sent before them. Allah is aware of evil-doers.<br>
96. And thou wilt find them greediest of mankind for life and [greedier] than<br>
the idolaters. [Each] one of them would like to be allowed to live a thousand<br>
years. And to live [a thousand years] would be no means remove him from the<br>
doom. Allah is Seer of what they do.<br>
<br>
6<br>
<br>
97. Say [O Muhammad, to mankind]: Who is an enemy to Gabriel! For he it is who<br>
hath revealed [this Scripture] to thy heart by Allah's leave, confirming that<br>
which was [revealed] before it, and a guidance and glad tidings to believers;<br>
98. Who is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and His messengers, and Gabriel and<br>
Michael! Then, lo! Allah [Himself] is an enemy to the disbelievers.<br>
99. Verily We have revealed unto thee clear tokens, and only miscreants will<br>
disbelieve in them.<br>
100. Is it ever so that when they make a covenant a party of them set it aside?<br>
The truth is, most of them believe not.<br>
101. And when there cometh unto them a messenger from Allah, confirming that<br>
which they possess, a party of those who have received the Scripture fling the<br>
Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they knew not,<br>
102. And follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of<br>
Solomon. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved, teaching mankind<br>
magic and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Harut and Marut.<br>
Nor did they [the two angels] teach it to anyone till they had said: We are only<br>
a temptation, therefore disbelieve not [in the guidance of Allah]. And from<br>
these two [angles] people learn that by which they cause division between man<br>
and wife; but they injure thereby no-one save by Allah's leave. And they learn<br>
that which harmeth them and profiteth them not. And surely they do know that he<br>
who trafficketh therein will have no [happy] portion in the Hereafter; and<br>
surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls, if they but knew.<br>
103. And if they had believed and kept from evil, a recompense from Allah would<br>
be better, if they only knew.<br>
104. O ye who believe, say not [unto the Prophet]: "Listen to us" but say "Look<br>
upon us," and be ye listeners. For disbelievers is a painful doom.<br>
105. Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture nor the<br>
idolaters love that there should be sent down unto you any good thing from your<br>
Lord. But Allah chooseth for His mercy whom He will, and Allah is of Infinite<br>
Bounty.<br>
106. Nothing of our revelation [even a single verse] do we abrogate or cause be<br>
forgotten, but we bring [in place] one better or the like thereof. Knowest thou<br>
not that Allah is Able to do all things?<br>
107. Knowest thou not that it is Allah unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of<br>
the heavens and the earth; and ye have not, beside Allah, any guardian or<br>
helper?<br>
108. Or would ye question your messenger as Moses was questioned aforetime? He<br>
who chooseth disbelief instead of faith, verily he hath gone astray from a plain<br>
road.<br>
109. Many of the people of the Scripture long to make you disbelievers after<br>
your belief, through envy on their own account, after the truth hath become<br>
manifest unto them. Forgive and be indulgent [toward them] until Allah give<br>
command. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
110. Establish worship, and pay the poor-due; and whatever of good ye send<br>
before [you] for your souls, ye will find it with Allah. Lo! Allah is Seer of<br>
what ye do.<br>
111. And they say: None entereth paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.<br>
These are their own desires. Say: Bring your proof [of what ye state] if ye are<br>
truthful.<br>
<br>
7<br>
<br>
112. Nay, but whosoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good, his<br>
reward is with his Lord; and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall<br>
they grieve.<br>
113. And the Jews say the Christians follow nothing [true], and the Christians<br>
say the Jews follow nothing [true]; yet both are readers of the Scripture. Even<br>
thus speak those who know not. Allah will judge between them on the Day of<br>
Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ.<br>
114. And who doth greater wrong than he who forbiddeth the approach to the<br>
sanctuaries of Allah lest His name should be mentioned therein, and striveth for<br>
their ruin. As for such, it was never meant that they should enter them except<br>
in fear. Theirs in the world is ignominy and theirs in the Hereafter is an awful<br>
doom.<br>
115. Unto Allah belong the East and the West, and whithersoever ye turn, there<br>
is Allah's Countenance. Lo! Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.<br>
116. And they say: Allah hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He glorified! Nay,<br>
but whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth is His. All are subservient unto<br>
Him.<br>
117. The Originator of the heavens and the earth! When He decreeth a thing, He<br>
saith unto it only: Be! and it is.<br>
118. And those who have no knowledge say: Why doth not Allah speak unto us, or<br>
some sign come unto us? Even thus, as they now speak, spake those [who were]<br>
before them. Their hearts are all alike. We have made clear the revelations for<br>
people who are sure.<br>
119. Lo! We have sent thee [O Muhammad] with the truth, a bringer of glad<br>
tidings and a warner. And thou wilt not be asked about the owners of hell-fire.<br>
120. And the Jews will not be pleased with thee, nor will the Christians, till<br>
thou follow their creed. Say: Lo! the guidance of Allah [Himself] is Guidance.<br>
And if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come<br>
unto thee, then wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting guardian nor helper.<br>
121. Those unto whom We have given the Scripture, who read it with the right<br>
reading, those believe in it. And whoso disbelieveth in it, those are they who<br>
are the losers.<br>
122. O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and how I<br>
preferred you to [all] creatures.<br>
123. And guard [yourselves] against a day when no soul will in aught avail<br>
another, nor will compensation be accepted from it, nor will intercession be of<br>
use to it; nor will they be helped.<br>
124. And [remember] when his Lord tried Abraham with [His] commands, and he<br>
fulfilled them, He said: Lo! I have appointed thee a leader for mankind.<br>
[Abraham] said: And of my offspring [will there be leaders]? He said: My<br>
covenant includeth not wrong-doers.<br>
125. And when We made the House [at Makka] a resort for mankind and sanctuary,<br>
[saying]: Take as your place of worship the place where Abraham stood [to pray].<br>
And We imposed a duty upon Abraham and Ishmael, [saying]: Purify My house for<br>
those who go around and those who meditate therein and those who bow down and<br>
prostrate themselves [in worship].<br>
126. And when Abraham prayed: My Lord! Make this a region of security and bestow<br>
upon its people fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day, He<br>
<br>
8<br>
<br>
answered: As for him who disbelieveth, I shall leave him in contentment for a<br>
while, then I shall compel him to the doom of Fire - a hapless journey's end!<br>
127. And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House,<br>
[Abraham prayed]: Our Lord! Accept from us [this duty]. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art<br>
the Hearer, the Knower.<br>
128. Our Lord! And make us submissive unto Thee and of our seed a nation<br>
submissive unto Thee, and show us our ways of worship, and relent toward us. Lo!<br>
Thou, only Thou, art the Relenting, the Merciful.<br>
129. Our Lord! And raise up in their midst a messenger from among them who shall<br>
recite unto them Thy revelations, and shall instruct them in the Scripture and<br>
in wisdom and shall make them grow. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, Wise.<br>
130. And who forsaketh the religion of Abraham save him who befooleth himself?<br>
Verily We chose him in the world, and lo! in the Hereafter he is among the<br>
righteous.<br>
131. When his Lord said unto him: Surrender! he said: I have surrendered to the<br>
Lord of the Worlds.<br>
132. The same did Abraham enjoin upon his sons, and also Jacob, [saying]: O my<br>
sons! Lo! Allah hath chosen for you the [true] religion; therefore die not save<br>
as men who have surrendered [unto Him].<br>
133. Or were ye present when death came to Jacob, when he said unto his sons:<br>
What will ye worship after me? They said: We shall worship thy god, the god of<br>
thy fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, One Allah, and unto Him we have<br>
surrendered.<br>
134. Those are a people who have passed away. Theirs is that which they earned,<br>
and yours is that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what they used to<br>
do.<br>
135. And they say: Be Jews or Christians, then ye will be rightly guided. Say<br>
[unto them, O Muhammad]: Nay, but [we follow] the religion of Abraham, the<br>
upright, and he was not of the idolaters.<br>
136. Say [O Muslims]: We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and<br>
that which was revealed unto Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the<br>
tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and that which the prophets<br>
received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto<br>
Him we have surrendered.<br>
137. And if they believe in the like of that which ye believe, then are they<br>
rightly guided. But if they turn away, then are they in schism, and Allah will<br>
suffice thee [for defence] against them. He is the Hearer, the Knower.<br>
138. [We take our] colour from Allah, and who is better than Allah at colouring.<br>
We are His worshippers.<br>
139. Say [unto the People of the Scripture]: Dispute ye with us concerning Allah<br>
when He is our Lord and your Lord? Ours are our works and yours your works. We<br>
look to Him alone.<br>
140. Or say ye that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes<br>
were Jews or Christians? Say: Do ye know best, or doth Allah? And who is more<br>
unjust than he who hideth a testimony which he hath received from Allah? Allah<br>
is not unaware of what ye do.<br>
141. Those are a people who have passed away; theirs is that which they earned<br>
and yours that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what they used to do.<br>
<br>
9<br>
<br>
142. The foolish of the people will say: What hath turned them from the qiblah<br>
which they formerly observed? Say: Unto Allah belong the East and the West. He<br>
guideth whom He will unto a straight path.<br>
143. Thus We have appointed you a middle nation, that ye may be witnesses<br>
against mankind, and that the messenger may be a witness against you. And We<br>
appointed the qiblah which ye formerly observed only that We might know him who<br>
followeth the messenger, from him who turneth on his heels. In truth it was a<br>
hard [test] save for those whom Allah guided. But it was not Allah's purpose<br>
that your faith should be in vain, for Allah is Full of Pity, Merciful toward<br>
mankind.<br>
144. We have seen the turning of thy face to heaven [for guidance, O Muhammad].<br>
And now verily We shall make thee turn [in prayer] toward a qiblah which is dear<br>
to thee. So turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye [O<br>
Muslims], wheresoever ye may be, turn your faces [when ye pray] toward it. Lo!<br>
Those who have received the Scripture know that [this revelation] is the Truth<br>
from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do.<br>
145. And even if thou broughtest unto those who have received the Scripture all<br>
kinds of portents, they would not follow thy qiblah, nor canst thou be a<br>
follower of their qiblah; nor are some of them followers of the qiblah of<br>
others. And if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath<br>
come unto thee, then surely wert thou of the evil-doers.<br>
146. Those unto whom We gave the Scripture recognise [this revelation] as they<br>
recognise their sons. But lo! a party of them knowingly conceal the truth.<br>
147. It is the Truth from thy Lord [O Muhammad], so be not thou of those who<br>
waver.<br>
148. And each one hath a goal toward which he turneth; so vie with one another<br>
in good works. Wheresoever ye may be, Allah will bring you all together. Lo!<br>
Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
149. And whencesoever thou comest forth [for prayer, O Muhammad] turn thy face<br>
toward the Inviolable Place of Worship. Lo! it is the Truth from thy Lord. Allah<br>
is not unaware of what ye do.<br>
150. Whencesoever thou comest forth turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of<br>
Worship; and wheresoever ye may be [O Muslims] turn your faces toward it [when<br>
ye pray] so that men may have no argument against you, save such of them as do<br>
injustice - Fear them not, but fear Me! - and so that I may complete My grace<br>
upon you, and that ye may be guided.<br>
151. Even as We have sent unto you a messenger from among you, who reciteth unto<br>
you Our revelations and causeth you to grow, and teacheth you the Scripture and<br>
wisdom, and teacheth you that which ye knew not.<br>
152. Therefore remember Me, I will remember you. Give thanks to Me, and reject<br>
not Me.<br>
153. O ye who believe! Seek help in steadfastness and prayer. Lo! Allah is with<br>
the steadfast.<br>
154. And call not those who are slain in the way of Allah "dead." Nay, they are<br>
living, only ye perceive not.<br>
155. And surely We shall try you with something of fear and hunger, and loss of<br>
wealth and lives and crops; but give glad tidings to the steadfast,<br>
156. Who say, when a misfortune striketh them: Lo! we are Allah's and lo! unto<br>
Him we are returning.<br>
<br>
10<br>
<br>
157. Such are they on whom are blessings from their Lord, and mercy. Such are<br>
the rightly guided.<br>
158. Lo! [the mountains] As-Safa and Al-Marwah are among the indications of<br>
Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who is on pilgrimage to the House [of<br>
Allah] or visiteth it, to go around them [as the pagan custom is]. And he who<br>
doeth good of his own accord, [for him] lo! Allah is Responsive, Aware.<br>
159. Lo! Those who hide the proofs and the guidance which We revealed, after We<br>
had made it clear to mankind in the Scripture: such are accursed of Allah and<br>
accursed of those who have the power to curse.<br>
160. Except those who repent and amend and make manifest [the truth]. These it<br>
is toward whom I relent. I am the Relenting, the Merciful.<br>
161. Lo! Those who disbelieve, and die while they are disbelievers; on them is<br>
the curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined.<br>
162. They ever dwell therein. The doom will not be lightened for them, neither<br>
will they be reprieved.<br>
163. Your Allah is One Allah; there is no Allah save Him, the Beneficent, the<br>
Merciful.<br>
164. Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of<br>
night and day, and the ships which run upon the sea with that which is of use to<br>
men, and the water which Allah sendeth down from the sky, thereby reviving the<br>
earth after its death, and dispersing all kinds of beasts therein, and [in] the<br>
ordinance of the winds, and the clouds obedient between heaven and earth: are<br>
signs [of Allah's Sovereignty] for people who have sense.<br>
165. Yet of mankind are some who take unto themselves [objects of worship which<br>
they set as] rivals to Allah, loving them with a love like [that which is the<br>
due] of Allah [only] - those who believe are stauncher in their love for Allah Oh, that those who do evil had but known, [on the day] when they behold the<br>
doom, that power belongeth wholly to Allah, and that Allah is severe in<br>
punishment!<br>
166. [On the day] when those who were followed disown those who followed [them],<br>
and they behold the doom, and all their aims collapse with them.<br>
167. And those who were but followers will say: If a return were possible for<br>
us, we would disown them even as they have disowned us. Thus will Allah show<br>
them their own deeds as anguish for them, and they will not emerge from the<br>
Fire.<br>
168. O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and wholesome in the earth, and<br>
follow not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! he is an open enemy for you.<br>
169. He enjoineth upon you only the evil and the foul, and that ye should tell<br>
concerning Allah that which ye know not.<br>
170. And when it is said unto them: Follow that which Allah hath revealed, they<br>
say: We follow that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even though their<br>
fathers were wholly unintelligent and had no guidance?<br>
171. The likeness of those who disbelieve [in relation to the messenger] is as<br>
the likeness of one who calleth unto that which heareth naught except a shout<br>
and cry. Deaf, dumb, blind, therefore they have no sense.<br>
172. O ye who believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you,<br>
and render thanks to Allah if it is [indeed] He Whom ye worship.<br>
<br>
11<br>
<br>
173. He hath forbidden you only carrion, and blood, and swineflesh, and that<br>
which hath been immolated to [the name of] any other than Allah. But he who is<br>
driven by necessity, neither craving nor transgressing, it is no sin for him.<br>
Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
174. Lo! those who hide aught of the Scripture which Allah hath revealed and<br>
purchase a small gain therewith, they eat into their bellies nothing else than<br>
fire. Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make<br>
them grow. Theirs will be a painful doom.<br>
175. Those are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, and torment at<br>
the price of pardon. How constant are they in their strife to reach the Fire!<br>
176. That is because Allah hath revealed the Scripture with the truth. Lo! those<br>
who find [a cause of] disagreement in the Scripture are in open schism.<br>
177. It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces to the East and the West;<br>
but righteous is he who believeth in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and<br>
the Scripture and the prophets; and giveth wealth, for love of Him, to kinsfolk<br>
and to orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and to those who ask, and to set<br>
slaves free; and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor-due. And those who<br>
keep their treaty when they make one, and the patient in tribulation and<br>
adversity and time of stress. Such are they who are sincere. Such are the Allahfearing.<br>
178. O ye who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the<br>
murdered; the freeman for the freeman, and the slave for the slave, and the<br>
female for the female. And for him who is forgiven somewhat by his [injured]<br>
brother, prosecution according to usage and payment unto him in kindness. This<br>
is an alleviation and a mercy from your Lord. He who transgresseth after this<br>
will have a painful doom.<br>
179. And there is life for you in retaliation, O men of understanding, that ye<br>
may ward off [evil].<br>
180. It is prescribed for you, when death approacheth one of you, if he leave<br>
wealth, that he bequeath unto parents and near relatives in kindness. [This is]<br>
a duty for all those who ward off [evil].<br>
181. And whoso changeth [the will] after he hath heard it - the sin thereof is<br>
only upon those who change it. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower.<br>
182. But he who feareth from a testator some unjust or sinful clause, and maketh<br>
peace between the parties, [it shall be] no sin for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving,<br>
Merciful.<br>
183. O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you, even as it was prescribed<br>
for those before you, that ye may ward off [evil];<br>
184. [Fast] a certain number of days; and [for] him who is sick among you, or on<br>
a journey, [the same] number of other days; and for those who can afford it<br>
there is a ransom: the feeding of a man in need - but whoso doeth good of his<br>
own accord, it is better for him: and that ye fast is better for you if ye did<br>
but know 185. The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for<br>
mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance, and the Criterion [of right and<br>
wrong]. And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month, and whosoever<br>
of you is sick or on a journey, [let him fast the same] number of other days.<br>
Allah desireth for you ease; He desireth not hardship for you; and [He desireth]<br>
that ye should complete the period, and that ye should magnify Allah for having<br>
guided you, and that peradventure ye may be thankful.<br>
<br>
12<br>
<br>
186. And when My servants question thee concerning Me, then surely I am nigh. I<br>
answer the prayer of the suppliant when he crieth unto Me. So let them hear My<br>
call and let them trust in Me, in order that they may be led aright.<br>
187. It is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of the<br>
fast. They are raiment for you and ye are raiment for them. Allah is Aware that<br>
ye were deceiving yourselves in this respect and He hath turned in mercy toward<br>
you and relieved you. So hold intercourse with them and seek that which Allah<br>
hath ordained for you, and eat and drink until the white thread becometh<br>
distinct to you from the black thread of the dawn. Then strictly observe the<br>
fast till nightfall and touch them not, but be at your devotions in the mosques.<br>
These are the limits imposed by Allah, so approach them not. Thus Allah<br>
expoundeth His revelation to mankind that they may ward off [evil].<br>
188. And eat not up your property among yourselves in vanity, nor seek by it to<br>
gain the hearing of the judges that ye may knowingly devour a portion of the<br>
property of others wrongfully.<br>
189. They ask thee, [O Muhammad], of new moons, say: They are fixed seasons for<br>
mankind and for the pilgrimage. It is not righteousness that ye go to houses by<br>
the backs thereof [as do the idolaters at certain seasons], but the righteous<br>
man is he who wardeth off [evil]. So go to houses by the gates thereof, and<br>
observe your duty to Allah, that ye may be successful.<br>
190. Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but begin<br>
not hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors.<br>
191. No, please don't kill anyone! Thanks! :)<br>
192. But if they desist, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
193. And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah. But<br>
if they desist, then let there be no hostility except against wrong-doers.<br>
194. The forbidden month for the forbidden month, and forbidden things in<br>
retaliation. And one who attacketh you, attack him in like manner as he attacked<br>
you. Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is with those who ward off<br>
[evil].<br>
195. Spend your wealth for the cause of Allah, and be not cast by your own hands<br>
to ruin; and do good. Lo! Allah loveth the beneficent.<br>
196. Perform the pilgrimage and the visit [to Makka] for Allah. And if ye are<br>
prevented, then send such gifts as can be obtained with ease, and shave not your<br>
heads until the gifts have reached their destination. And whoever among you is<br>
sick or hath an ailment of the head must pay a ransom of fasting or almsgiving<br>
or offering. And if ye are in safety, then whosoever contenteth himself with the<br>
visit for the pilgrimage [shall give] such gifts as can be had with ease. And<br>
whosoever cannot find [such gifts], then a fast of three days while on the<br>
pilgrimage, and of seven when ye have returned; that is, ten in all. That is for<br>
him whoso folk are not present at the Inviolable Place of Worship. Observe your<br>
duty to Allah, and know that Allah is severe in punishment.<br>
197. The pilgrimage is [in] the well-known months, and whoever is minded to<br>
perform the pilgrimage therein [let him remember that] there is [to be] no<br>
lewdness nor abuse nor angry conversation on the pilgrimage. And whatsoever good<br>
ye do Allah knoweth it. So make provision for yourselves [Hereafter]; for the<br>
<br>
13<br>
<br>
best provision is to ward off evil. Therefore keep your duty unto Me, O men of<br>
understanding.<br>
198. It is no sin for you that ye seek the bounty of your Lord [by trading].<br>
But, when ye press on in the multitude from 'Arafat, remember Allah by the<br>
sacred monument. Remember Him as He hath guided you, although before ye were of<br>
those astray.<br>
199. Then hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hasteneth onward,<br>
and ask forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
200. And when ye have completed your devotions, then remember Allah as ye<br>
remember your fathers or with a more lively remembrance. But of mankind is he<br>
who saith: "Our Lord! Give unto us in the world," and he hath no portion in the<br>
Hereafter.<br>
201. And of them [also] is he who saith: "Our Lord! Give unto us in the world<br>
that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and guard us from<br>
the doom of Fire."<br>
202. For them there is in store a goodly portion out of that which they have<br>
earned. Allah is swift at reckoning.<br>
203. Remember Allah through the appointed days. Then whoso hasteneth [his<br>
departure] by two days, it is no sin for him, and whoso delayeth, it is no sin<br>
for him; that is for him who wardeth off [evil]. Be careful of your duty to<br>
Allah, and know that unto Him ye will be gathered.<br>
204. And of mankind there is he whoso conversation on the life of this world<br>
pleaseth thee [Muhammad], and he calleth Allah to witness as to that which is in<br>
his heart; yet he is the most rigid of opponents.<br>
205. And when he turneth away [from thee] his effort in the land is to make<br>
mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle; and Allah loveth not<br>
mischief.<br>
206. And when it is said unto him: Be careful of thy duty to Allah, pride taketh<br>
him to sin. Hell will settle his account, an evil resting-place.<br>
207. And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah;<br>
and Allah hath compassion on [His] bondmen.<br>
208. O ye who believe! Come, all of you, into submission [unto Him]; and follow<br>
not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! he is an open enemy for you.<br>
209. And if ye slide back after the clear proofs have come unto you, then know<br>
that Allah is Mighty, Wise.<br>
210. Wait they for naught else than that Allah should come unto them in the<br>
shadows of the clouds with the angels? Then the case would be already judged.<br>
All cases go back to Allah [for judgment].<br>
211. Ask of the Children of Israel how many a clear revelation We gave them! He<br>
who altereth the grace of Allah after it hath come unto him [for him], lo! Allah<br>
is severe in punishment.<br>
212. Beautified is the life of the world for those who disbelieve; they make a<br>
jest of the believers. But those who keep their duty to Allah will be above them<br>
on the Day of Resurrection. Allah giveth without stint to whom He will.<br>
213. Mankind were one community, and Allah sent [unto them] prophets as bearers<br>
of good tidings and as warners, and revealed therewith the Scripture with the<br>
truth that it might judge between mankind concerning that wherein they differed.<br>
And only those unto whom [the Scripture] was given differed concerning it, after<br>
<br>
14<br>
<br>
clear proofs had come unto them, through hatred one of another. And Allah by His<br>
Will guided those who believe unto the truth of that concerning which they<br>
differed. Allah guideth whom He will unto a straight path.<br>
214. Or think ye that ye will enter paradise while yet there hath not come unto<br>
you the like of [that which came to] those who passed away before you?<br>
Affliction and adversity befell them, they were shaken as with earthquake, till<br>
the messenger [of Allah] and those who believed along with him said: When cometh<br>
Allah's help? Now surely Allah's help is nigh.<br>
215. They ask thee, [O Muhammad], what they shall spend. Say: that which ye<br>
spend for good [must go] to parents and near kindred and orphans and the needy<br>
and the wayfarer. And whatsoever good ye do, lo! Allah is Aware of it.<br>
216. Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you; but it may<br>
happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you, and it may happen that ye<br>
love a thing which is bad for you. Allah knoweth, ye know not.<br>
217. They question thee [O Muhammad] with regard to warfare in the sacred month.<br>
Say: Warfare therein is a great [transgression], but to turn [men] from the way<br>
of Allah, and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship, and<br>
to expel His people thence, is a greater with Allah; for persecution is worse<br>
than killing. And they will not cease from fighting against you till they have<br>
made you renegades from your religion, if they can. And whoso becometh a<br>
renegade and dieth in his disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen both<br>
in the world and the Hereafter. Such are rightful owners of the Fire: they will<br>
abide therein.<br>
218. Lo! those who believe, and those who emigrate [to escape the persecution]<br>
and strive in the way of Allah, these have hope of Allah's mercy. Allah is<br>
Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
219. They question thee about strong drink and games of chance. Say: In both is<br>
great sin, and [some] utility for men; but the sin of them is greater than their<br>
usefulness. And they ask thee what they ought to spend. Say: that which is<br>
superfluous. Thus Allah maketh plain to you [His] revelations, that haply ye may<br>
reflect.<br>
220. Upon the world and the Hereafter. And they question thee concerning<br>
orphans. Say: To improve their lot is best. And if ye mingle your affairs with<br>
theirs, then [they are] your brothers. Allah knoweth him who spoileth from him<br>
who improveth. Had Allah willed He could have overburdened you. Allah is Mighty,<br>
Wise.<br>
221. Wed not idolatresses till they believe; for lo! a believing bondwoman is<br>
better than an idolatress though she please you; and give not your daughters in<br>
marriage to idolaters till they believe, for lo! a believing slave is better<br>
than an idolater though he please you. These invite unto the Fire, and Allah<br>
inviteth unto the Garden, and unto forgiveness by His grace, and expoundeth His<br>
revelations to mankind that haply they may remember.<br>
222. They question thee [O Muhammad] concerning menstruation. Say: It is an<br>
illness, so let women alone at such times and go not in unto them till they are<br>
cleansed. And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah<br>
hath enjoined upon you. Truly Allah loveth those who turn unto Him, and loveth<br>
those who have a care for cleanness.<br>
223. Your women are a tilth for you [to cultivate] so go to your tilth as ye<br>
will, and send [good deeds] before you for your souls, and fear Allah, and know<br>
that ye will [one day] meet Him. Give glad tidings to believers, [O Muhammad].<br>
<br>
15<br>
<br>
224. And make not Allah, by your oaths, a hindrance to your being righteous and<br>
observing your duty unto Him and making peace among mankind. Allah is Hearer,<br>
Knower.<br>
225. Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your<br>
oaths. But He will take you to task for that which your hearts have garnered.<br>
Allah is Forgiving, Clement.<br>
226. Those who forswear their wives must wait four months; then, if they change<br>
their mind, lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
227. And if they decide upon divorce [let them remember that] Allah is Hearer,<br>
Knower.<br>
228. Women who are divorced shall wait, keeping themselves apart, three<br>
[monthly] courses. And it is not lawful for them that they should conceal that<br>
which Allah hath created in their wombs if they are believers in Allah and the<br>
Last Day. And their husbands would do better to take them back in that case if<br>
they desire a reconciliation. And they [women] have rights similar to those [of<br>
men] over them in kindness, and men are a degree above them. Allah is Mighty,<br>
Wise.<br>
229. Divorce must be pronounced twice and then [a woman] must be retained in<br>
honour or released in kindness. And it is not lawful for you that ye take from<br>
women aught of that which ye have given them; except [in the case] when both<br>
fear that they may not be able to keep within the limits [imposed by] Allah. And<br>
if ye fear that they may not be able to keep the limits of Allah, in that case<br>
it is no sin for either of them if the woman ransom herself. These are the<br>
limits [imposed by] Allah. Transgress them not. For whoso transgresseth Allah's<br>
limits: such are wrong-doers.<br>
230. And if he hath divorced her [the third time], then she is not lawful unto<br>
him thereafter until she hath wedded another husband. Then if he [the other<br>
husband] divorce her it is no sin for both of them that they come together again<br>
if they consider that they are able to observe the limits of Allah. These are<br>
the limits of Allah. He manifesteth them for people who have knowledge.<br>
231. When ye have divorced women, and they have reached their term, then retain<br>
them in kindness or release them in kindness. Retain them not to their hurt so<br>
that ye transgress [the limits]. He who doeth that hath wronged his soul. Make<br>
not the revelations of Allah a laughing-stock [by your behaviour], but remember<br>
Allah's grace upon you and that which He hath revealed unto you of the Scripture<br>
and of wisdom, whereby He doth exhort you. Observe your duty to Allah and know<br>
that Allah is Aware of all things.<br>
232. And when ye have divorced women and they reach their term, place not<br>
difficulties in the way of their marrying their husbands if it is agreed between<br>
them in kindness. This is an admonition for him among you who believeth in Allah<br>
and the Last Day. That is more virtuous for you, and cleaner. Allah knoweth; ye<br>
know not.<br>
233. Mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years; [that is] for<br>
those who wish to complete the suckling. The duty of feeding and clothing<br>
nursing mothers in a seemly manner is upon the father of the child. No-one<br>
should be charged beyond his capacity. A mother should not be made to suffer<br>
because of her child, nor should he to whom the child is born [be made to<br>
suffer] because of his child. And on the [father's] heir is incumbent the like<br>
of that [which was incumbent on the father]. If they desire to wean the child by<br>
mutual consent and [after] consultation, it is no sin for them; and if ye wish<br>
to give your children out to nurse, it is no sin for you, provide that ye pay<br>
<br>
16<br>
<br>
what is due from you in kindness. Observe your duty to Allah, and know that<br>
Allah is Seer of what ye do.<br>
234. Such of you as die and leave behind them wives, they [the wives] shall<br>
wait, keeping themselves apart, four months and ten days. And when they reach<br>
the term [prescribed for them] then there is no sin for you in aught that they<br>
may do with themselves in decency. Allah is informed of what ye do.<br>
235. There is no sin for you in that which ye proclaim or hide in your minds<br>
concerning your troth with women. Allah knoweth that ye will remember them. But<br>
plight not your troth with women except by uttering a recognised form of words.<br>
And do not consummate the marriage until [the term] prescribed is run. Know that<br>
Allah knoweth what is in your minds, so beware of Him; and know that Allah is<br>
Forgiving, Clement.<br>
236. It is no sin for you if ye divorce women while yet ye have not touched<br>
them, nor appointed unto them a portion. Provide for them, the rich according to<br>
his means, and the straitened according to his means, a fair provision. [This<br>
is] a bounden duty for those who do good.<br>
237. If ye divorce them before ye have touched them and ye have appointed unto<br>
them a portion, then [pay the] half of that which ye appointed, unless they [the<br>
women] agree to forgo it, or he agreeth to forgo it in whose hand is the<br>
marriage tie. To forgo is nearer to piety. And forget not kindness among<br>
yourselves. Allah is Seer of what ye do.<br>
238. Be guardians of your prayers, and of the midmost prayer, and stand up with<br>
devotion to Allah.<br>
239. And if ye go in fear, then [pray] standing or on horseback. And when ye are<br>
again in safety, remember Allah, as He hath taught you that which [heretofore]<br>
ye knew not.<br>
240. [In the case of] those of you who are about to die and leave behind them<br>
wives, they should bequeath unto their wives a provision for the year without<br>
turning them out, but if they go out [of their own accord] there is no sin for<br>
you in that which they do of themselves within their rights. Allah is Mighty,<br>
Wise.<br>
241. For divorced women a provision in kindness: a duty for those who ward off<br>
[evil].<br>
242. Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations so that ye may understand.<br>
243. Bethink thee [O Muhammad] of those of old, who went forth from their<br>
habitations in their thousands, fearing death, and Allah said unto them: Die;<br>
and then He brought them back to life. Lo! Allah is a Lord of Kindness to<br>
mankind, but most of mankind give not thanks.<br>
244. Fight in the way of Allah, and know that Allah is Hearer, Knower.<br>
245. Who is it that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan, so that He may give it<br>
increase manifold? Allah straiteneth and enlargeth. Unto Him ye will return.<br>
246. Bethink thee of the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses, how they<br>
said unto a prophet whom they had: Set up for us a king and we will fight in<br>
Allah's way. He said: Would ye then refrain from fighting if fighting were<br>
prescribed for you? They said: Why should we not fight in Allah's way when we<br>
have been driven from our dwellings with our children? Yet, when fighting was<br>
prescribed for them, they turned away, all save a few of them. Allah is aware of<br>
evil-doers.<br>
<br>
17<br>
<br>
247. Their Prophet said unto them: Lo! Allah hath raised up Saul to be a king<br>
for you. They said: How can he have kingdom over us when we are more deserving<br>
of the kingdom than he is, since he hath not been given wealth enough? He said:<br>
Lo! Allah hath chosen him above you, and hath increased him abundantly in wisdom<br>
and stature. Allah bestoweth His Sovereignty on whom He will. Allah is AllEmbracing, All-Knowing.<br>
248. And their Prophet said unto them: Lo! the token of his kingdom is that<br>
there shall come unto you the ark wherein is peace of reassurance from your<br>
Lord, and a remnant of that which the house of Moses and the house of Aaron left<br>
behind, the angels bearing it. Lo! herein shall be a token for you if [in truth]<br>
ye are believers.<br>
249. And when Saul set out with the army, he said: Lo! Allah will try you by<br>
[the ordeal of] a river. Whosoever therefore drinketh thereof he is not of me,<br>
and whosoever tasteth it not he is of me, save him who taketh [thereof] in the<br>
hollow of his hand. But they drank thereof, all save a few of them. And after he<br>
had crossed [the river], he and those who believed with him, they said: We have<br>
no power this day against Goliath and his hosts. But those who knew that they<br>
would meet Allah exclaimed: How many a little company hath overcome a mighty<br>
host by Allah's leave! Allah is with the steadfast.<br>
250. And when they went into the field against Goliath and his hosts they said:<br>
Our Lord! Bestow on us endurance, make our foothold sure, and give us help<br>
against the disbelieving folk.<br>
251. So they routed them by Allah's leave and David slew Goliath; and Allah gave<br>
him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him of that which He willeth. And if<br>
Allah had not repelled some men by others the earth would have been corrupted.<br>
But Allah is a Lord of Kindness to [His] creatures.<br>
252. These are the portents of Allah which We recite unto thee [Muhammad] with<br>
truth, and lo! thou art of the number of [Our] messengers;<br>
253. Of those messengers, some of whom We have caused to excel others, and of<br>
whom there are some unto whom Allah spake, while some of them He exalted [above<br>
others] in degree; and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs [of Allah's<br>
Sovereignty] and We supported him with the holy Spirit. And if Allah had so<br>
wiled it, those who followed after them would not have fought one with another<br>
after the clear proofs had come unto them. But they differed, some of them<br>
believing and some disbelieving. And if Allah had so willed it, they would not<br>
have fought one with another; but Allah doeth what He will.<br>
254. O ye who believe! spend of that wherewith We have provided you ere a day<br>
come when there will be no trafficking, nor friendship, nor intercession. The<br>
disbelievers, they are the wrong-doers.<br>
255. Allah! There is no deity save Him, the Alive, the Eternal. Neither slumber<br>
nor sleep overtaketh Him. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and<br>
whatsoever is in the earth. Who is he that intercedeth with Him save by His<br>
leave? He knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them,<br>
while they encompass nothing of His knowledge save what He will. His throne<br>
includeth the heavens and the earth, and He is never weary of preserving them.<br>
He is the Sublime, the Tremendous.<br>
256. There is no compulsion in religion. The right direction is henceforth<br>
distinct from error. And he who rejecteth false deities and believeth in Allah<br>
hath grasped a firm handhold which will never break. Allah is Hearer, Knower.<br>
257. Allah is the Protecting Guardian of those who believe. He bringeth them out<br>
of darkness into light. As for those who disbelieve, their patrons are false<br>
<br>
18<br>
<br>
deities. They bring them out of light into darkness. Such are rightful owners of<br>
the Fire. They will abide therein.<br>
258. Bethink thee of him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord,<br>
because Allah had given him the kingdom; how, when Abraham said: My Lord is He<br>
Who giveth life and causeth death, he answered: I give life and cause death.<br>
Abraham said: Lo! Allah causeth the sun to rise in the East, so do thou cause it<br>
to come up from the West. Thus was the disbeliever abashed. And Allah guideth<br>
not wrongdoing folk.<br>
259. Or [bethink thee of] the like of him who, passing by a township which had<br>
fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this township life after<br>
its death? And Allah made him die a hundred years, then brought him back to<br>
life. He said: How long hast thou tarried? [The man] said: I have tarried a day<br>
or part of a day. [He] said: Nay, but thou hast tarried for a hundred years.<br>
Just look at thy food and drink which have not rotted! Look at thine ass! And,<br>
that We may make thee a token unto mankind, look at the bones, how We adjust<br>
them and then cover them with flesh! And when [the matter] became clear unto<br>
him, he said: I know now that Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
260. And when Abraham said [unto his Lord]: My Lord! Show me how Thou givest<br>
life to the dead, He said: Dost thou not believe? Abraham said: Yea, but [I ask]<br>
in order that my heart may be at ease. [His Lord] said: Take four of the birds<br>
and cause them to incline unto thee, then place a part of them on each hill,<br>
then call them, they will come to thee in haste, and know that Allah is Mighty,<br>
Wise.<br>
261. The likeness of those who spend their wealth in Allah's way is as the<br>
likeness of a grain which groweth seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains.<br>
Allah giveth increase manifold to whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing, AllKnowing.<br>
262. Those who spend their wealth for the cause of Allah and afterward make not<br>
reproach and injury to follow that which they have spent; their reward is with<br>
their Lord, and there shall no fear come upon them, neither shall they grieve.<br>
263. A kind word with forgiveness is better than almsgiving followed by injury.<br>
Allah is Absolute, Clement.<br>
264. O ye who believe! Render not vain your almsgiving by reproach and injury,<br>
like him who spendeth his wealth only to be seen of men and believeth not in<br>
Allah and the Last Day. His likeness is as the likeness of a rock whereon is<br>
dust of earth; a rainstorm smiteth it, leaving it smooth and bare. They have no<br>
control of aught of that which they have gained. Allah guideth not the<br>
disbelieving folk.<br>
265. And the likeness of those who spend their wealth in search of Allah's<br>
pleasure, and for the strengthening of their souls, is as the likeness of a<br>
garden on a height. The rainstorm smiteth it and it bringeth forth its fruit<br>
twofold. And if the rainstorm smite it not, then the shower. Allah is Seer of<br>
what ye do.<br>
266. Would any of you like to have a garden of palm-trees and vines, with rivers<br>
flowing underneath it, with all kinds of fruit for him therein; and old age hath<br>
stricken him and he hath feeble offspring; and a fiery whirlwind striketh it and<br>
it is [all] consumed by fire. Thus Allah maketh plain His revelations unto you,<br>
in order that ye may give thought.<br>
267. O ye who believe! Spend of the good things which ye have earned, and of<br>
that which We bring forth from the earth for you, and seek not the bad [with<br>
<br>
19<br>
<br>
intent] to spend thereof [in charity] when ye would not take it for yourselves<br>
save with disdain; and know that Allah is Absolute, Owner of Praise.<br>
268. The devil promiseth you destitution and enjoineth on you lewdness. But<br>
Allah promiseth you forgiveness from Himself with bounty. Allah is AllEmbracing, All-knowing.<br>
269. He giveth wisdom unto whom He will, and he unto whom wisdom is given, he<br>
truly hath received abundant good. But none remember except men of<br>
understanding.<br>
270. Whatever alms ye spend or vow ye vow, lo! Allah knoweth it. Wrong-doers<br>
have no helpers.<br>
271. If ye publish your almsgiving, it is well, but if ye hide it and give it to<br>
the poor, it will be better for you, and will atone for some of your ill-deeds.<br>
Allah is Informed of what ye do.<br>
272. The guiding of them is not thy duty [O Muhammad], but Allah guideth whom He<br>
will. And whatsoever good thing ye spend, it is for yourselves, when ye spend<br>
not save in search of Allah's Countenance; and whatsoever good thing ye spend,<br>
it will be repaid to you in full, and ye will not be wronged.<br>
273. [Alms are] for the poor who are straitened for the cause of Allah, who<br>
cannot travel in the land [for trade]. The unthinking man accounteth them<br>
wealthy because of their restraint. Thou shalt know them by their mark: They do<br>
not beg of men with importunity. And whatsoever good thing ye spend, lo! Allah<br>
knoweth it.<br>
274. Those who spend their wealth by night and day, by stealth and openly,<br>
verily their reward is with their Lord, and their shall no fear come upon them<br>
neither shall they grieve.<br>
275. Those who swallow usury cannot rise up save as he ariseth whom the devil<br>
hath prostrated by [his] touch. That is because they say: Trade is just like<br>
usury; whereas Allah permitteth trading and forbiddeth usury. He unto whom an<br>
admonition from his Lord cometh, and [he] refraineth [in obedience thereto], he<br>
shall keep [the profits of] that which is past, and his affair [henceforth] is<br>
with Allah. As for him who returneth [to usury] - Such are rightful owners of<br>
the Fire. They will abide therein.<br>
276. Allah hath blighted usury and made almsgiving fruitful. Allah loveth not<br>
the impious and guilty.<br>
277. Lo! those who believe and do good works and establish worship and pay the<br>
poor-due, their reward is with their Lord and there shall no fear come upon them<br>
neither shall they grieve.<br>
278. O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah, and give up what remaineth<br>
[due to you] from usury, if ye are [in truth] believers.<br>
279. And if ye do not, then be warned of war [against you] from Allah and His<br>
messenger. And if ye repent, then ye have your principal [without interest].<br>
Wrong not, and ye shall not be wronged.<br>
280. And if the debtor is in straitened circumstances, then [let there be]<br>
postponement to [the time of] ease; and that ye remit the debt as almsgiving<br>
would be better for you if ye did but know.<br>
281. And guard yourselves against a day in which ye will be brought back to<br>
Allah. Then every soul will be paid in full that which it hath earned, and they<br>
will not be wronged.<br>
<br>
20<br>
<br>
282. O ye who believe! When ye contract a debt for a fixed term, record it in<br>
writing. Let a scribe record it in writing between you in [terms of] equity. No<br>
scribe should refuse to write as Allah hath taught him, so let him write, and<br>
let him who incurreth the debt dictate, and let him observe his duty to Allah<br>
his Lord, and diminish naught thereof. But if he who oweth the debt is of low<br>
understanding, or weak, or unable himself to dictate, then let the guardian of<br>
his interests dictate in [terms of] equity. And call to witness, from among your<br>
men, two witnesses. And if two men be not [at hand] then a man and two women, of<br>
such as ye approve as witnesses, so that if the one erreth [through<br>
forgetfulness] the other will remember. And the witnesses must not refuse when<br>
they are summoned. Be not averse to writing down [the contract] whether it be<br>
small or great, with [record of] the term thereof. That is more equitable in the<br>
sight of Allah and more sure for testimony, and the best way of avoiding doubt<br>
between you; save only in the case when it is actual merchandise which ye<br>
transfer among yourselves from hand to hand. In that case it is no sin for you<br>
if ye write it not. And have witnesses when ye sell one to another, and let no<br>
harm be done to scribe or witness. If ye do [harm to them] lo! it is a sin in<br>
you. Observe your duty to Allah. Allah is teaching you. And Allah is knower of<br>
all things.<br>
283. If ye be on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a pledge in hand<br>
[shall suffice]. And if one of you entrusteth to another let him who is trusted<br>
deliver up that which is entrusted to him [according to the pact between them]<br>
and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord. Hide not testimony. He who<br>
hideth it, verily his heart is sinful. Allah is Aware of what ye do.<br>
284. Unto Allah [belongeth] whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in<br>
the earth; and whether ye make known what is in your minds or hide it, Allah<br>
will bring you to account for it. He will forgive whom He will and He will<br>
punish whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
285. The messenger believeth in that which hath been revealed unto him from his<br>
Lord and [so do] believers. Each one believeth in Allah and His angels and His<br>
scriptures and His messengers - We make no distinction between any of His<br>
messengers - and they say: We hear, and we obey. [Grant us] Thy forgiveness, our<br>
Lord. Unto Thee is the journeying.<br>
286. Allah tasketh not a soul beyond its scope. For it [is only] that which it<br>
hath earned, and against it [only] that which it hath deserved. Our Lord!<br>
Condemn us not if we forget, or miss the mark! Our Lord! Lay not on us such a<br>
burden as thou didst lay on those before us! Our Lord! Impose not on us that<br>
which we have not the strength to bear! Pardon us, absolve us and have mercy on<br>
us, Thou, our Protector, and give us victory over the disbelieving folk.<br>
<br>
SURA 3. AL-E-IMRAN (THE FAMILY OF 'IMRAN, THE<br>
HOUSE OF 'IMRAN)<br>
1. Alim. Lam. Mim.<br>
2. Allah! There is no Allah save Him, the Alive, the Eternal.<br>
3. He hath revealed unto thee [Muhammad] the Scripture with truth, confirming<br>
that which was [revealed] before it, even as He revealed the Torah and the<br>
Gospel.<br>
4. Aforetime, for a guidance to mankind; and hath revealed the Criterion [of<br>
right and wrong]. Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah, theirs will<br>
be a heavy doom. Allah is Mighty, Able to Requite [the wrong].<br>
21<br>
<br>
5. Lo! nothing in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah.<br>
6. He it is Who fashioneth you in the wombs as pleaseth Him. There is no Allah<br>
save Him, the Almighty, the Wise.<br>
7. He it is Who hath revealed unto thee [Muhammad] the Scripture wherein are<br>
clear revelations - they are the substance of the Book - and others [which are]<br>
allegorical. But those in whose hearts is doubt pursue, forsooth, that which is<br>
allegorical seeking [to cause] dissension by seeking to explain it. None knoweth<br>
its explanation save Allah. And those who are of sound instruction say: We<br>
believe therein; the whole is from our Lord; but only men of understanding<br>
really heed.<br>
8. Our Lord! Cause not our hearts to stray after Thou hast guided us, and bestow<br>
upon us mercy from Thy Presence. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Bestower.<br>
9. Our Lord! Lo! it is Thou Who gatherest mankind together to a Day of which<br>
there is no doubt. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst.<br>
10. [On that Day] neither the riches nor the progeny of those who disbelieve<br>
will aught avail them with Allah. They will be fuel for Fire.<br>
11. Like Pharaoh's folk and those who were before them, they disbelieved Our<br>
revelations and so Allah seized them for their sins. And Allah is severe in<br>
punishment.<br>
12. Say [O Muhammad] unto those who disbelieve: Ye shall be overcome and<br>
gathered unto Hell, an evil resting-place.<br>
13. There was a token for you in two hosts which met: one army fighting in the<br>
way of Allah, and another disbelieving, whom they saw as twice their number,<br>
clearly, with their very eyes. Thus Allah strengtheneth with His succour whom He<br>
will. Lo! herein verily is a lesson for those who have eyes.<br>
14. Beautified for mankind is love of the joys [that come] from women and<br>
offspring; and stored-up heaps of gold and silver, and horses branded [with<br>
their mark], and cattle and land. That is comfort of the life of the world.<br>
Allah! With Him is a more excellent abode.<br>
15. Say: Shall I inform you of something better than that? For those who keep<br>
from evil, with their Lord, are Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein<br>
they will abide, and pure companions, and contentment from Allah. Allah is Seer<br>
of His bondmen,<br>
16. Those who say: Our Lord! Lo! we believe. So forgive us our sins and guard us<br>
from the punishment of Fire;<br>
17. The steadfast, and the truthful, and the obedient, those who spend [and<br>
hoard not], those who pray for pardon in the watches of the night.<br>
18. Allah [Himself] is Witness that there is no Allah save Him. And the angels<br>
and the men of learning [too are witness]. Maintaining His creation in justice,<br>
there is no Allah save Him the Almighty, the Wise.<br>
19. Lo! religion with Allah [is] the Surrender [to His Will and Guidance]. Those<br>
who [formerly] received the Scripture differed only after knowledge came unto<br>
them, through transgression among themselves. Whoso disbelieveth the revelations<br>
of Allah [will find that] lo! Allah is swift at reckoning.<br>
20. And if they argue with thee, [O Muhammad], say:<br>
purpose to Allah and [so have] those who follow me.<br>
received the Scripture and those who read not: Have<br>
they surrender, then truly they are rightly guided,<br>
<br>
22<br>
<br>
I have surrendered my<br>
And say unto those who have<br>
ye [too] surrendered? If<br>
and if they turn away, then<br>
<br>
it is thy duty only to convey the message [unto them]. Allah is Seer of [His]<br>
bondmen.<br>
21. Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah, and slay the prophets<br>
wrongfully, and slay those of mankind who enjoin equity: promise them a painful<br>
doom.<br>
22. Those are they whose works have failed in the world and the Hereafter; and<br>
they have no helpers.<br>
23. Hast thou not seen how those who have received a portion of the Scripture<br>
invoke the Scripture of Allah [in their disputes] that it may judge between<br>
them; then a faction of them turn away, being opposed [to it]?<br>
24. That is because they say: The Fire will not touch us save for a certain<br>
number of days. That which they used to invent hath deceived them regarding<br>
their religion.<br>
25. How [will it be with them] when We have brought them all together to a Day<br>
of which there is no doubt, when every soul will be paid in full what it hath<br>
earned, and they will not be wronged.<br>
26. Say: O Allah! Owner of Sovereignty! Thou givest sovereignty unto whom Thou<br>
wilt, and Thou withdrawest sovereignty from whom Thou wilt. Thou exaltest whom<br>
Thou wilt, and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt. In Thy hand is the good. Lo! Thou<br>
art Able to do all things.<br>
27. Thou causest the night to pass into the day, and Thou causest the day to<br>
pass into the night. And Thou bringest forth the living from the dead, and Thou<br>
bringest forth the dead from the living. And Thou givest sustenance to whom Thou<br>
choosest, without stint.<br>
28. Let not the believers take disbelievers for their friends in preference to<br>
believers. Whoso doeth that hath no connection with Allah unless [it be] that ye<br>
but guard yourselves against them, taking [as it were] security. Allah biddeth<br>
you beware [only] of Himself. Unto Allah is the journeying.<br>
29. Say, [O Muhammad]: Whether ye hide that which is in your breasts or reveal<br>
it, Allah knoweth it. He knoweth that which is in the heavens and that which is<br>
in the earth, and Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
30. On the Day when every soul will find itself confronted with all that it hath<br>
done of good and all that it hath done of evil [every soul] will long that there<br>
might be a mighty space of distance between it and that [evil]. Allah biddeth<br>
you beware of Him. And Allah is Full of Pity for [His] bondmen.<br>
31. Say, [O Muhammad, to mankind]: If ye love Allah, follow me; Allah will love<br>
you and forgive you your sins. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
32. Say: Obey Allah and the messenger. But if they turn away, lo! Allah loveth<br>
not the disbelievers [in His guidance].<br>
33. Lo! Allah preferred Adam and Noah and the Family of Abraham and the Family<br>
of 'Imran above [all His] creatures.<br>
34. They were descendants one of another. Allah is Hearer, Knower.<br>
35. [Remember] when the wife of 'Imran said: My Lord! I have vowed unto Thee<br>
that which is in my belly as a consecrated [offering]. Accept it from me. Lo!<br>
Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower!<br>
36. And when she was delivered she said: My Lord! Lo! I am delivered of a female<br>
- Allah knew best of what she was delivered - the male is not as the female; and<br>
<br>
23<br>
<br>
lo! I have named her Mary, and lo! I crave Thy protection for her and for her<br>
offspring from Satan the outcast.<br>
37. And her Lord accepted her with full acceptance and vouchsafed to her a<br>
goodly growth; and made Zachariah her guardian. Whenever Zachariah went into the<br>
sanctuary where she was, he found that she had food. He said: O Mary! Whence<br>
cometh unto thee this [food]? She answered: It is from Allah. Allah giveth<br>
without stint to whom He will.<br>
38. Then Zachariah prayed unto his Lord and said: My Lord! Bestow upon me of Thy<br>
bounty goodly offspring. Lo! Thou art the Hearer of Prayer.<br>
39. And the angels called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary: Allah<br>
giveth thee glad tidings of [a son whose name is] John, [who cometh] to confirm<br>
a word from Allah lordly, chaste, a prophet of the righteous.<br>
40. He said: My Lord! How can I have a son when age hath overtaken me already<br>
and my wife is barren? [The angel] answered: So [it will be]. Allah doeth what<br>
He will.<br>
41. He said: My Lord! Appoint a token for me. [The angel] said: The token unto<br>
thee [shall be] that thou shalt not speak unto mankind three days except by<br>
signs. Remember thy Lord much, and praise [Him] in the early hours of night and<br>
morning.<br>
42. And when the angels said: O Mary! Lo! Allah hath chosen thee and made thee<br>
pure, and hath preferred thee above [all] the women of creation.<br>
43. O Mary! Be obedient to thy Lord, prostrate thyself and bow with those who<br>
bow [in worship].<br>
44. This is of the tidings of things hidden. We reveal it unto thee [Muhammad].<br>
Thou wast not present with them when they threw their pens [to know] which of<br>
them should be the guardian of Mary, nor wast thou present with them when they<br>
quarrelled [thereupon].<br>
45. [And remember] when the angels said: O Mary! Lo! Allah giveth thee glad<br>
tidings of a word from him, whose name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary,<br>
illustrious in the world and the Hereafter, and one of those brought near [unto<br>
Allah].<br>
46. He will speak unto mankind in his cradle and in his manhood, and he is of<br>
the righteous.<br>
47. She said: My Lord! How can I have a child when no mortal hath touched me? He<br>
said: So [it will be]. Allah createth what He will. If He decreeth a thing, He<br>
saith unto it only: Be! and it is.<br>
48. And He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, and the Torah and the<br>
Gospel,<br>
49. And will make him a messenger unto the Children of Israel, [saying]: Lo! I<br>
come unto you with a sign from your Lord. Lo! I fashion for you out of clay the<br>
likeness of a bird, and I breathe into it and it is a bird, by Allah's leave. I<br>
heal him who was born blind, and the leper, and I raise the dead, by Allah's<br>
leave. And I announce unto you what ye eat and what ye store up in your houses.<br>
Lo! herein verily is a portent for you, if ye are to be believers.<br>
50. And [I come] confirming that which was before me of the Torah, and to make<br>
lawful some of that which was forbidden unto you. I come unto you with a sign<br>
from your Lord, so keep your duty to Allah and obey me.<br>
51. Lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path.<br>
<br>
24<br>
<br>
52. But when Jesus became conscious of their disbelief, he cried: Who will be my<br>
helpers in the cause of Allah? The disciples said: We will be Allah's helpers.<br>
We believe in Allah, and bear thou witness that we have surrendered [unto Him].<br>
53. Our Lord! We believe in that which Thou hast revealed and we follow him whom<br>
Thou hast sent. Enrol us among those who witness [to the truth].<br>
54. And they [the disbelievers] schemed, and Allah schemed [against them]: and<br>
Allah is the best of schemers.<br>
55. [And remember] when Allah said: O Jesus! Lo! I am gathering thee and causing<br>
thee to ascend unto Me, and am cleansing thee of those who disbelieve and am<br>
setting those who follow thee above those who disbelieve until the Day of<br>
Resurrection. Then unto Me ye will [all] return, and I shall judge between you<br>
as to that wherein ye used to differ.<br>
56. As for those who disbelieve I shall chastise them with a heavy chastisement<br>
in the world and the Hereafter; and they will have no helpers.<br>
57. And as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their wages<br>
in full. Allah loveth not wrong-doers.<br>
58. This [which] We recite unto thee is a revelation and a wise reminder.<br>
59. Lo! the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of Adam. He created<br>
him of dust, then He said unto him: Be! and he is.<br>
60. [This is] the truth from thy Lord [O Muhammad], so be not thou of those who<br>
waver.<br>
61. And whoso disputeth with thee concerning him, after the knowledge which hath<br>
come unto thee, say [unto him]: Come! We will summon our sons and your sons, and<br>
our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, then we will pray humbly<br>
[to our Lord] and [solemnly] invoke the curse of Allah upon those who lie.<br>
62. Lo! This verily is the true narrative. There is no Allah save Allah, and lo!<br>
Allah, He verily is, is the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
63. And if they turn away, then lo! Allah is Aware of [who are] the corrupters.<br>
64. Say: O People of the Scripture! Come to an agreement between us and you:<br>
that we shall worship none but Allah, and that we shall ascribe no partner unto<br>
Him, and that none of us shall take others for lords beside Allah. And if they<br>
turn away, then say: Bear witness that we are they who have surrendered [unto<br>
Him].<br>
65. O People of the Scripture! Why will ye argue about Abraham, when the Torah<br>
and the Gospel were not revealed till after him? Have ye then no sense?<br>
66. Lo! ye are those who argue about that whereof ye have some knowledge: Why<br>
then argue ye concerning that whereof ye have no knowledge? Allah knoweth. Ye<br>
know not.<br>
67. Abraham was not a Jew, nor yet a Christian; but he was an upright man who<br>
had surrendered [to Allah], and he was not of the idolaters.<br>
68. Lo! those of mankind who have the best claim to Abraham are those who<br>
followed him, and this Prophet and those who believe [with him]; and Allah is<br>
the Protecting Guardian of the believers.<br>
69. A party of the People of the Scripture long to make you go astray; and they<br>
make none to go astray except themselves, but they perceive not.<br>
70. O People of the Scripture! Why disbelieve ye in the revelations of Allah,<br>
when ye [yourselves] bear witness [to their truth]?<br>
<br>
25<br>
<br>
71. O People of the Scripture! Why confound ye truth with falsehood and<br>
knowingly conceal the truth?<br>
72. And a party of the People of the Scripture say: Believe in that which hath<br>
been revealed unto those who believe at the opening of the day, and disbelieve<br>
at the end thereof, in order that they may return;<br>
73. And believe not save in one who followeth your religion - Say [O Muhammad]:<br>
Lo! the guidance is Allah's Guidance - that anyone is given the like of that<br>
which was given unto you or that they may argue with you in the presence of<br>
their Lord. Say [O Muhammad]: Lo! the bounty is in Allah's hand. He bestoweth it<br>
on whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.<br>
74. He selecteth for His mercy whom He will. Allah is of Infinite Bounty.<br>
75. Among the People of the Scripture there is he who, if thou trust him with a<br>
weight of treasure, will return it to thee. And among them there is he who, if<br>
thou trust him with a piece of gold, will not return it to thee unless thou keep<br>
standing over him. That is because they say: We have no duty to the Gentiles.<br>
They speak a lie concerning Allah knowingly.<br>
76. Nay, but [the chosen of Allah is] he who fulfilleth his pledge and wardeth<br>
off [evil]; for lo! Allah loveth those who ward off [evil].<br>
77. Lo! those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and<br>
their oaths, they have no portion in the Hereafter. Allah will neither speak to<br>
them nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow.<br>
Theirs will be a painful doom.<br>
78. And lo! there is a party of them who distort the Scripture with their<br>
tongues, that ye may think that what they say is from the Scripture, when it is<br>
not from the Scripture. And they say: It is from Allah, when it is not from<br>
Allah; and they speak a lie concerning Allah knowingly.<br>
79. It is not [possible] for any human being unto whom Allah had given the<br>
Scripture and wisdom and the prophethood that he should afterwards have said<br>
unto mankind: Be slaves of me instead of Allah; but [what he said was]: Be ye<br>
faithful servants of the Lord by virtue of your constant teaching of the<br>
Scripture and of your constant study thereof.<br>
80. And he commanded you not that ye should take the angels and the prophets for<br>
lords. Would he command you to disbelieve after ye had surrendered [to Allah]?<br>
81. When Allah made [His] covenant with the prophets, [He said]: Behold that<br>
which I have given you of the Scripture and knowledge. And afterward there will<br>
come unto you a messenger, confirming that which ye possess. Ye shall believe in<br>
him and ye shall help him. He said: Do ye agree, and will ye take up My burden<br>
[which I lay upon you] in this [matter]? They answered: We agree. He said: Then<br>
bear ye witness. I will be a witness with you.<br>
82. Then whosoever after this shall turn away: they will be miscreants.<br>
83. Seek they other than the religion of Allah, when unto Him submitteth<br>
whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and unto<br>
Him they will be returned.<br>
84. Say [O Muhammad]: We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and<br>
that which was revealed unto Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the<br>
tribes, and that which was vouchsafed unto Moses and Jesus and the prophets from<br>
their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have<br>
surrendered.<br>
<br>
26<br>
<br>
85. And whoso seeketh as religion other than the Surrender [to Allah] it will<br>
not be accepted from him, and he will be a loser in the Hereafter.<br>
86. How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and<br>
[after] they bore witness that the messenger is true and after clear proofs [of<br>
Allah's Sovereignty] had come unto them. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.<br>
87. As for such, their guerdon is that on them rests the curse of Allah and of<br>
angels and of men combined.<br>
88. They will abide therein. Their doom will not be lightened, neither will they<br>
be reprieved;<br>
89. Save those who afterward repent and do right. Lo! Allah is Forgiving,<br>
Merciful.<br>
90. Lo! those who disbelieve after their [profession of] belief, and afterward<br>
grow violent in disbelief: their repentance will not be accepted. And such are<br>
those who are astray.<br>
91. Lo! those who disbelieve, and die in disbelief, the [whole] earth full of<br>
gold would not be accepted from such an one if it were offered as a ransom [for<br>
his soul]. Theirs will be a painful doom and they will have no helpers.<br>
92. Ye will not attain unto piety until ye spend of that which ye love. And<br>
whatsoever ye spend, Allah is Aware thereof.<br>
93. All food was lawful unto the Children of Israel, save that which Israel<br>
forbade himself, [in days] before the Torah was revealed. Say: Produce the Torah<br>
and read it [unto us] if ye are truthful.<br>
94. And whoever shall invent a falsehood after that concerning Allah, such will<br>
be wrong-doers.<br>
95. Say: Allah speaketh truth. So follow the religion of Abraham, the upright.<br>
He was not of the idolaters.<br>
96. Lo! the first Sanctuary appointed for mankind was that at Becca, a blessed<br>
place, a guidance to the peoples;<br>
97. Wherein are plain memorials [of Allah's guidance]; the place where Abraham<br>
stood up to pray; and whosoever entereth it is safe. And pilgrimage to the House<br>
is a duty unto Allah for mankind, for him who can find a way thither. As for him<br>
who disbelieveth, [let him know that] lo! Allah is Independent of [all]<br>
creatures.<br>
98. Say: O People of the Scripture! Why disbelieve ye in the revelations of<br>
Allah, when Allah [Himself] is Witness of what ye do?<br>
99. Say: O People of the Scripture! Why drive ye back believers from the way of<br>
Allah, seeking to make it crooked, when ye are witnesses [to Allah's guidance]?<br>
Allah is not unaware of what ye do.<br>
100. O ye who believe! If ye obey a party of those who have received the<br>
Scripture they will make you disbelievers after your belief.<br>
101. How can ye disbelieve, when it is ye unto whom Allah's revelations are<br>
recited, and His messenger is in your midst? He who holdeth fast to Allah, he<br>
indeed is guided unto a right path.<br>
102. O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah with right observance, and die<br>
not save as those who have surrendered [unto Him]<br>
103. And hold fast, all of you together, to the cable of Allah, and do not<br>
separate. And remember Allah's favour unto you: How ye were enemies and He made<br>
<br>
27<br>
<br>
friendship between your hearts so that ye became as brothers by His grace; and<br>
[how] ye were upon the brink of an abyss of fire, and He did save you from it.<br>
Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations unto you, that haply ye may be guided,<br>
104. And there may spring from you a nation who invite to goodness, and enjoin<br>
right conduct and forbid indecency. Such are they who are successful.<br>
105. And be ye not as those who separated and disputed after the clear proofs<br>
had come unto them. For such there is an awful doom,<br>
106. On the Day when [some] faces will be whitened and [some] faces will be<br>
blackened; and as for those whose faces have been blackened, it will be said<br>
unto them: Disbelieved ye after your [profession of] belief? Then taste the<br>
punishment for that ye disbelieved.<br>
107. And as for those whose faces have been whitened, in the mercy of Allah they<br>
dwell for ever.<br>
108. These are revelations of Allah. We recite them unto thee in truth. Allah<br>
willeth no injustice to [His] creatures.<br>
109. Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the<br>
earth; and unto Allah all things are returned.<br>
110. Ye are the best community that hath been raised up for mankind. Ye enjoin<br>
right conduct and forbid indecency; and ye believe in Allah. And if the People<br>
of the Scripture had believed it had been better for them. Some of them are<br>
believers; but most of them are evil-livers.<br>
111. They will not harm you save a trifling hurt, and if they fight against you<br>
they will turn and flee. And afterward they will not be helped.<br>
112. Ignominy shall be their portion wheresoever they are found save [where they<br>
grasp] a rope from Allah and a rope from men. They have incurred anger from<br>
their Lord, and wretchedness is laid upon them. That is because they used to<br>
disbelieve the revelations of Allah, and slew the prophets wrongfully. That is<br>
because they were rebellious and used to transgress.<br>
113. They are not all alike. Of the People of the Scripture there is a staunch<br>
community who recite the revelations of Allah in the night season, falling<br>
prostrate [before Him].<br>
114. They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin right conduct and forbid<br>
indecency, and vie one with another in good works. These are of the righteous.<br>
115. And whatever good they do, they will not be denied the meed thereof. Allah<br>
is Aware of those who ward off [evil].<br>
116. Lo! the riches and the progeny of those who disbelieve will not avail them<br>
aught against Allah; and such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide<br>
therein.<br>
117. The likeness of that which they spend in this life of the world is as the<br>
likeness of a biting, icy wind which smiteth the harvest of a people who have<br>
wronged themselves, and devastateth it. Allah wronged them not, but they do<br>
wrong themselves.<br>
118. O ye who believe! Take not for intimates others than your own folk, who<br>
would spare no pains to ruin you; they love to hamper you. Hatred is revealed by<br>
[the utterance of] their mouths, but that which their breasts hide is greater.<br>
We have made plain for you the revelations if ye will understand.<br>
119. Lo! ye are those who love them though they love you not, and ye believe in<br>
all the Scripture. When they fall in with you they say: We believe; but when<br>
<br>
28<br>
<br>
they go apart they bite their finger-tips at you, for rage. Say: Perish in your<br>
rage! Lo! Allah is Aware of what is hidden in [your] breasts.<br>
120. If a lucky chance befall you, it is evil unto them, and if disaster strike<br>
you they rejoice thereat. But if ye persevere and keep from evil their guile<br>
will never harm you. Lo! Allah is Surrounding what they do.<br>
121. And when thou settedst forth at daybreak from thy housefolk to assign to<br>
the believers their positions for the battle, Allah was Hearer, Knower.<br>
122. When two parties of you almost fell away, and Allah was their Protecting<br>
Friend. In Allah let believers put their trust.<br>
123. Allah had already given you the victory at Badr, when ye were contemptible.<br>
So observe your duty to Allah in order that ye may be thankful.<br>
124. When thou didst say unto the believers: Is it not sufficient for you that<br>
your Lord should support you with three thousand angels sent down [to your<br>
help]?<br>
125. Nay, but if ye persevere, and keep from evil, and [the enemy] attack you<br>
suddenly, your Lord will help you with five thousand angels sweeping on.<br>
126. Allah ordained this only as a message of good cheer for you, and that<br>
thereby your hearts might be at rest - Victory cometh only from Allah, the<br>
Mighty, the Wise 127. That He may cut off a part of those who disbelieve, or overwhelm them so<br>
that they retire, frustrated.<br>
128. It is no concern at all of thee [Muhammad] whether He relent toward them or<br>
punish them; for they are evil-doers.<br>
129. Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the<br>
earth. He forgiveth whom He will, and punisheth whom He will. Allah is<br>
Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
130. O ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubling and quadrupling [the sum<br>
lent]. Observe your duty to Allah, that ye may be successful.<br>
131. And ward off [from yourselves] the Fire prepared for disbelievers.<br>
132. And obey Allah and the messenger, that ye may find mercy.<br>
133. And vie one with another for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a paradise<br>
as wide as are the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who ward off<br>
[evil];<br>
134. Those who spend [of that which Allah hath given them] in ease and in<br>
adversity, those who control their wrath and are forgiving toward mankind; Allah<br>
loveth the good;<br>
135. And those who, when they do an evil thing or wrong themselves, remember<br>
Allah and implore forgiveness for their sins - Who forgiveth sins save Allah<br>
only? - and will not knowingly repeat [the wrong] they did.<br>
136. The reward of such will be forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens<br>
underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever - a bountiful<br>
reward for workers!<br>
137. Systems have passed away before you. Do but travel in the land and see the<br>
nature of the consequence for those who did deny [the messengers].<br>
138. This is a declaration for mankind, a guidance and an admonition unto those<br>
who ward off [evil]<br>
<br>
29<br>
<br>
139. Faint not nor grieve, for ye will overcome them if ye are [indeed]<br>
believers.<br>
140. If ye have received a blow, the [disbelieving] people have received a blow<br>
the like thereof. These are [only] the vicissitudes which We cause to follow one<br>
another for mankind, to the end that Allah may know those who believe and may<br>
choose witnesses from among you; and Allah loveth not wrong-doers.<br>
141. And that Allah may prove those who believe, and may blight the<br>
disbelievers.<br>
142. Or deemed ye that ye would enter paradise while yet Allah knoweth not those<br>
of you who really strive, nor knoweth those [of you] who are steadfast?<br>
143. And verily ye used to wish for death before ye met it [in the field]. Now<br>
ye have seen it with your eyes!<br>
144. Muhammad is but a messenger, messengers [the like of whom] have passed away<br>
before him. Will it be that, when he dieth or is slain, ye will turn back on<br>
your heels? He who turneth back on his heels doth no hurt to Allah, and Allah<br>
will reward the thankful.<br>
145. No soul can ever die except by Allah's leave and at a term appointed. Whoso<br>
desireth the reward of the world, We bestow on him thereof; and whoso desireth<br>
the reward of the Hereafter, We bestow on him thereof. We shall reward the<br>
thankful.<br>
146. And with how many a prophet have there been a number of devoted men who<br>
fought [beside him]. They quailed not for aught that befell them in the way of<br>
Allah, nor did they weaken, nor were they brought low. Allah loveth the<br>
steadfast.<br>
147. Their cry was only that they said: Our Lord! forgive us for our sins and<br>
wasted efforts, make our foothold sure, and give us victory over the<br>
disbelieving folk.<br>
148. So Allah gave them the reward of the world and the good reward of the<br>
Hereafter. Allah loveth those whose deeds are good.<br>
149. O ye who believe! if ye obey those who disbelieve, they will make you turn<br>
back on your heels, and ye turn back as losers.<br>
150. But Allah is your Protector, and He is the Best of Helpers.<br>
151. We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they<br>
ascribe unto Allah partners, for which no warrant hath been revealed. Their<br>
habitation is the Fire, and hapless the abode of the wrong-doers.<br>
152. Allah verily made good His promise unto you when ye routed them by His<br>
leave, until [the moment] when your courage failed you, and ye disagreed about<br>
the order and ye disobeyed, after He had shown you that for which ye long. Some<br>
of you desired the world, and some of you desired the Hereafter. Therefore He<br>
made you flee from them, that He might try you. Yet now He hath forgiven you.<br>
Allah is a Lord of Kindness to believers.<br>
153. When ye climbed [the hill] and paid no heed to anyone, while the messenger,<br>
in your rear, was calling you [to fight]. Therefor He rewarded you grief for<br>
[his] grief, that [He might teach] you not to sorrow either for that which ye<br>
missed or for that which befell you. Allah is Informed of what ye do.<br>
154. Then, after grief, He sent down security for you. As slumber did it<br>
overcome a party of you, while [the other] party, who were anxious on their own<br>
account, thought wrongly of Allah, the thought of ignorance. They said: Have we<br>
any part in the cause? Say [O Muhammad]: The cause belongeth wholly to Allah.<br>
30<br>
<br>
They hide within themselves [a thought] which they reveal not unto thee, saying:<br>
Had we had any part in the cause we should not have been slain here. Say: Even<br>
though ye had been in your houses, those appointed to be slain would have gone<br>
forth to the places where they were to lie. [All this hath been] in order that<br>
Allah might try what is in your breasts and prove what is in your hearts. Allah<br>
is Aware of what is hidden in the breasts [of men].<br>
155. Lo! those of you who turned back on the day when the two hosts met, Satan<br>
alone it was who caused them to backslide, because of some of that which they<br>
have earned. Now Allah hath forgiven them. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Clement.<br>
156. O ye who believe! Be not as those who disbelieved and said of their<br>
brethren who went abroad in the land or were fighting in the field: If they had<br>
been [here] with us they would not have died or been killed: that Allah may make<br>
it anguish in their hearts. Allah giveth life and causeth death; and Allah is<br>
Seer of what ye do.<br>
157. And what though ye be slain in Allah's way or die therein? Surely pardon<br>
from Allah and mercy are better than all that they amass.<br>
158. What though ye be slain or die, when unto Allah ye are gathered?<br>
159. It was by the mercy of Allah that thou wast lenient with them [O Muhammad],<br>
for if thou hadst been stern and fierce of heart they would have dispersed from<br>
round about thee. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult with<br>
them upon the conduct of affairs. And when thou art resolved, then put thy trust<br>
in Allah. Lo! Allah loveth those who put their trust [in Him].<br>
160. If Allah is your helper none can overcome you, and if He withdraw His help<br>
from you, who is there who can help you after Him? In Allah let believers put<br>
their trust.<br>
161. It is not for any prophet to embezzle. Whoso embezzleth will bring what he<br>
embezzled with him on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul will be paid in<br>
full what it hath earned; and they will not be wronged.<br>
162. Is one who followeth the pleasure of Allah as one who hath earned<br>
condemnation from Allah, whose habitation is the Fire, a hapless journey's end?<br>
163. There are degrees [of grace and reprobation] with Allah, and Allah is Seer<br>
of what they do.<br>
164. Allah verily hath shown grace to the believers by sending unto them a<br>
messenger of their own who reciteth unto them His revelations, and causeth them<br>
to grow, and teacheth them the Scripture and wisdom; although before [he came to<br>
them] they were in flagrant error.<br>
165. And was it so, when a disaster smote you, though ye had smitten [them with<br>
a disaster] twice [as great], that ye said: How is this? Say [unto them, O<br>
Muhammad]: It is from yourselves. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
166. That which befell you, on the day when the two armies met, was by<br>
permission of Allah; that He might know the true believers;<br>
167. And that He might know the hypocrites, unto whom it was said: Come, fight<br>
in the way of Allah, or defend yourselves. They answered: If we knew aught of<br>
fighting we would follow you. On that day they were nearer disbelief than faith.<br>
They utter with their mouths a thing which is not in their hearts. Allah is Best<br>
Aware of what they hide.<br>
168. Those who, while they sat at home, said of their brethren [who were<br>
fighting for the cause of Allah]: If they had been guided by us they would not<br>
<br>
31<br>
<br>
have been slain. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Then avert death from yourselves<br>
if ye are truthful.<br>
169. Think not of those, who are slain in the way of Allah, as dead. Nay, they<br>
are living. With their Lord they have provision.<br>
170. Jubilant [are they] because of that which Allah hath bestowed upon them of<br>
His bounty, rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are<br>
left behind: That there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.<br>
171. They rejoice because of favour from Allah and kindness, and that Allah<br>
wasteth not the wage of the believers.<br>
172. As for those who heard the call of Allah and His messenger after the harm<br>
befell them [in the fight]; for such of them as do right and ward off [evil],<br>
there is great reward.<br>
173. Those unto whom men said: Lo! the people have gathered against you,<br>
therefor fear them. [The threat of danger] but increased the faith of them and<br>
they cried: Allah is Sufficient for us! Most Excellent is He in Whom we trust!<br>
174. So they returned with grace and favour from Allah, and no harm touched<br>
them. They followed the good pleasure of Allah, and Allah is of Infinite Bounty.<br>
175. It is only the devil who would make [men] fear his partisans. Fear them<br>
not; fear Me, if ye are true believers.<br>
176. Let not their conduct grieve thee, who run easily to disbelief, for lo!<br>
they injure Allah not at all. It is Allah's Will to assign them no portion in<br>
the Hereafter, and theirs will be an awful doom.<br>
177. Those who purchase disbelief at the price of faith harm Allah not at all,<br>
but theirs will be a painful doom.<br>
178. And let not those who disbelieve imagine that the rein We give them bodeth<br>
good unto their souls. We only give them rein that they may grow in sinfulness.<br>
And theirs will be a shameful doom.<br>
179. It is not [the purpose] of Allah to leave you in your present state till He<br>
shall separate the wicked from the good. And it is not [the purpose of] Allah to<br>
let you know the Unseen. But Allah chooseth of His messengers whom He will, [to<br>
receive knowledge thereof]. So believe in Allah and His messengers. If ye<br>
believe and ward off [evil], yours will be a vast reward.<br>
180. And let not those who hoard up that which Allah hath bestowed upon them of<br>
His bounty think that it is better for them. Nay, it is worse for them. That<br>
which they hoard will be their collar on the Day of Resurrection. Allah's is the<br>
heritage of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is Informed of what ye do.<br>
181. Verily Allah heard the saying of those who said, [when asked for<br>
contributions to the war]: "Allah, forsooth, is poor, and we are rich!" We shall<br>
record their saying with their slaying of the prophets wrongfully and We shall<br>
say: Taste ye the punishment of burning!<br>
182. This is on account of that which your own hands have sent before [you to<br>
the judgment]. Allah is no oppressor of [His] bondmen.<br>
183. [The same are] those who say: Lo! Allah hath charged<br>
in any messenger until he bring us an offering which fire<br>
devour. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Messengers came unto<br>
miracles, and with that [very miracle] which ye describe.<br>
them? [Answer that] if ye are truthful!<br>
<br>
32<br>
<br>
us that we believe not<br>
[from heaven] shall<br>
you before me with<br>
Why then did ye slay<br>
<br>
184. And if they deny thee, even so did they deny messengers who were before<br>
thee, who came with miracles and with the Psalms and with the Scripture giving<br>
light.<br>
185. Every soul will taste of death. And ye will be paid on the Day of<br>
Resurrection only that which ye have fairly earned. Whoso is removed from the<br>
Fire and is made to enter paradise, he indeed is triumphant. The life of this<br>
world is but comfort of illusion.<br>
186. Assuredly ye will be tried in your property and in your persons, and ye<br>
will hear much wrong from those who were given the Scripture before you, and<br>
from the idolaters. But if ye persevere and ward off [evil], then that is of the<br>
steadfast heart of things.<br>
187. And [remember] when Allah laid a charge on those who had received the<br>
Scripture [He said]: Ye are to expound it to mankind and not to hide it. But<br>
they flung it behind their backs and bought thereby a little gain. Verily evil<br>
is that which they have gained thereby.<br>
188. Think not that those who exult in what they have given, and love to be<br>
praised for what they have not done - Think not, they are in safety from the<br>
doom. A painful doom is theirs.<br>
189. Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. Allah is<br>
Able to do all things.<br>
190. Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth and [in] the difference of<br>
night and day are tokens [of His Sovereignty] for men of understanding,<br>
191. Such as remember Allah, standing, sitting, and reclining, and consider the<br>
creation of the heavens and the earth, [and say]: Our Lord! Thou createdst not<br>
this in vain. Glory be to Thee! Preserve us from the doom of Fire.<br>
192. Our Lord! Whom Thou causest to enter the Fire: him indeed Thou hast<br>
confounded. For evil-doers there will be no helpers.<br>
193. Our Lord! Lo! we have heard a crier calling unto Faith: "Believe ye in your<br>
Lord!" So we believed. Our Lord! Therefor forgive us our sins, and remit from us<br>
our evil deeds, and make us die the death of the righteous.<br>
194. Our Lord! And give us that which Thou hast promised to us by Thy<br>
messengers. Confound us not upon the Day of Resurrection. Lo! Thou breakest not<br>
the tryst.<br>
195. And their Lord hath heard them [and He saith]: Lo! I suffer not the work of<br>
any worker, male or female, to be lost. Ye proceed one from another. So those<br>
who fled and were driven forth from their homes and suffered damage for My<br>
cause, and fought and were slain, verily I shall remit their evil deeds from<br>
them and verily I shall bring them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow - A<br>
reward from Allah. And with Allah is the fairest of rewards.<br>
196. Let not the vicissitude [of the success] of those who disbelieve, in the<br>
land, deceive thee [O Muhammad].<br>
197. It is but a brief comfort. And afterward their habitation will be hell, an<br>
ill abode.<br>
198. But those who keep their duty to their Lord, for them are Gardens<br>
underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will be safe for ever. A gift of<br>
welcome from their Lord. That which Allah hath in store is better for the<br>
righteous.<br>
199. And lo! of the People of the Scripture there are some who believe in Allah<br>
and that which is revealed unto you and that which was revealed unto them,<br>
33<br>
<br>
humbling themselves before Allah. They purchase not a trifling gain at the price<br>
of the revelations of Allah. Verily their reward is with their Lord. Lo! Allah<br>
is swift to take account.<br>
200. O ye who believe! Endure, outdo all others in endurance, be ready, and<br>
observe your duty to Allah, in order that ye may succeed.<br>
<br>
SURA 4. AN-NISA (WOMEN)<br>
1. O mankind! Be careful of your duty to your Lord Who created you from a single<br>
soul and from it created its mate and from them twain hath spread abroad a<br>
multitude of men and women. Be careful of your duty toward Allah in Whom ye<br>
claim [your rights] of one another, and toward the wombs [that bare you]. Lo!<br>
Allah hath been a watcher over you.<br>
2. Give unto orphans their wealth. Exchange not the good for the bad [in your<br>
management thereof] nor absorb their wealth into your own wealth. Lo! that would<br>
be a great sin.<br>
3. And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans, marry of the<br>
women, who seem good to you, two or three or four; and if ye fear that ye cannot<br>
do justice [to so many] then one [only] or [the captives] that your right hands<br>
possess. Thus it is more likely that ye will not do injustice.<br>
4. And give unto the women [whom ye marry] free gift of their marriage portions;<br>
but if they of their own accord remit unto you a part thereof, then ye are<br>
welcome to absorb it [in your wealth].<br>
5. Give not unto the foolish [what is in] your [keeping of their] wealth, which<br>
Allah hath given you to maintain; but feed and clothe them from it, and speak<br>
kindly unto them.<br>
6. Prove orphans till they reach the marriageable age; then, if ye find them of<br>
sound judgment, deliver over unto them their fortune; and devour it not by<br>
squandering and in haste lest they should grow up Whoso [of the guardians] is<br>
rich, let him abstain generously [from taking of the property of orphans]; and<br>
whoso is poor let him take thereof in reason [for his guardianship]. And when ye<br>
deliver up their fortune unto orphans, have [the transaction] witnessed in their<br>
presence. Allah sufficeth as a Reckoner.<br>
7. Unto the men [of a family] belongeth a share of that which parents and near<br>
kindred leave, and unto the women a share of that which parents and near kindred<br>
leave, whether it be little or much - a legal share.<br>
8. And when kinsfolk and orphans and the needy are present at the division [of<br>
the heritage], bestow on them therefrom and speak kindly unto them.<br>
9. And let those fear [in their behaviour toward orphans] who if they left<br>
behind them weak offspring would be afraid for them. So let them mind their duty<br>
to Allah, and speak justly.<br>
10. Lo! Those who devour the wealth of orphans wrongfully, they do but swallow<br>
fire into their bellies, and they will be exposed to burning flame.<br>
11. Allah chargeth you concerning [the provision for] your children: to the male<br>
the equivalent of the portion of two females, and if there be women more than<br>
two, then theirs is two-thirds of the inheritance, and if there be one [only]<br>
then the half. And to each of his parents a sixth of the inheritance, if he have<br>
a son; and if he have no son and his parents are his heirs, then to his mother<br>
appertaineth the third; and if he have brethren, then to his mother appertaineth<br>
the sixth, after any legacy he may have bequeathed, or debt [hath been paid].<br>
<br>
34<br>
<br>
Your parents and your children: Ye know not which of them is nearer unto you in<br>
usefulness. It is an injunction from Allah. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
12. And unto you belongeth a half of that which your wives leave, if they have<br>
no child; but if they have a child then unto you the fourth of that which they<br>
leave, after any legacy they may have bequeathed, or debt [they may have<br>
contracted, hath been paid]. And unto them belongeth the fourth of that which ye<br>
leave if ye have no child, but if ye have a child then the eighth of that which<br>
ye leave, after any legacy ye may have bequeathed, or debt [ye may have<br>
contracted, hath been paid]. And if a man or a woman have a distant heir [having<br>
left neither parent nor child], and he [or she] have a brother or a sister [only<br>
on the mother's side] then to each of them twain [the brother and the sister]<br>
the sixth, and if they be more than two, then they shall be sharers in the<br>
third, after any legacy that may have been bequeathed or debt [contracted] not<br>
injuring [the heirs by willing away more than a third of the heritage] hath been<br>
paid. A commandment from Allah. Allah is Knower, Indulgent.<br>
13. These are the limits [imposed by] Allah. Whoso obeyeth Allah and His<br>
messenger, He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow, where<br>
such will dwell for ever. That will be the great success.<br>
14. And whoso disobeyeth Allah and His messenger and transgresseth His limits,<br>
He will make him enter Fire, where he will dwell for ever; his will be a<br>
shameful doom.<br>
15. As for those of your women who are guilty of lewdness, call to witness four<br>
of you against them. And if they testify [to the truth of the allegation] then<br>
confine them to the houses until death take them or [until] Allah appoint for<br>
them a way [through new legislation].<br>
16. And as for the two of you who are guilty thereof, punish them both. And if<br>
they repent and improve, then let them be. Lo! Allah is ever relenting,<br>
Merciful.<br>
17. Forgiveness is only incumbent on Allah toward those who do evil in ignorance<br>
[and] then turn quickly [in repentance] to Allah. These are they toward whom<br>
Allah relenteth. Allah is ever Knower, Wise.<br>
18. The forgiveness is not for those who do ill-deeds until, when death<br>
attendeth upon one of them, he saith: Lo! I repent now; nor yet for those who<br>
die while they are disbelievers. For such We have prepared a painful doom.<br>
19. O ye who believe! It is not lawful for you forcibly to inherit the women [of<br>
your deceased kinsmen], nor [that] ye should put constraint upon them that ye<br>
may take away a part of that which ye have given them, unless they be guilty of<br>
flagrant lewdness. But consort with them in kindness, for if ye hate them it may<br>
happen that ye hate a thing wherein Allah hath placed much good.<br>
20. And if ye wish to exchange one wife for another and ye have given unto one<br>
of them a sum of money [however great], take nothing from it. Would ye take it<br>
by the way of calumny and open wrong?<br>
21. How can ye take it [back] after one of you hath gone in unto the other, and<br>
they have taken a strong pledge from you?<br>
22. And marry not those women whom your fathers married, except what hath<br>
already happened [of that nature] in the past. Lo! it was ever lewdness and<br>
abomination, and an evil way.<br>
23. Forbidden unto you are your mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters,<br>
and your father's sisters, and your mother's sisters, and your brother's<br>
daughters and your sister's daughters, and your foster-mothers, and your foster-<br>
<br>
35<br>
<br>
sisters, and your mothers-in-law, and your step-daughters who are under your<br>
protection [born] of your women unto whom ye have gone in - but if ye have not<br>
gone in unto them, then it is no sin for you [to marry their daughters] - and<br>
the wives of your sons who [spring] from your own loins. And [it is forbidden<br>
unto you] that ye should have two sisters together, except what hath already<br>
happened [of that nature] in the past. Lo! Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
24. And all married women [are forbidden unto you] save those [captives] whom<br>
your right hands possess. It is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are<br>
all beyond those mentioned, so that ye seek them with your wealth in honest<br>
wedlock, not debauchery. And those of whom ye seek content [by marrying them],<br>
give unto them their portions as a duty. And there is no sin for you in what ye<br>
do by mutual agreement after the duty [hath been done]. Lo! Allah is ever<br>
Knower, Wise.<br>
25. And whoso is not able to afford to marry free, believing women, let them<br>
marry from the believing maids whom your right hands possess. Allah knoweth best<br>
[concerning] your faith. Ye [proceed] one from another; so wed them by<br>
permission of their folk, and give unto them their portions in kindness, they<br>
being honest, not debauched nor of loose conduct. And if when they are<br>
honourably married they commit lewdness they shall incur the half of the<br>
punishment [prescribed] for free women [in that case]. This is for him among you<br>
who feareth to commit sin. But to have patience would be better for you. Allah<br>
is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
26. Allah would explain to you and guide you by the examples of those who were<br>
before you, and would turn to you in mercy. Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
27. And Allah would turn to you in mercy; but those who follow vain desires<br>
would have you go tremendously astray.<br>
28. Allah would make the burden light for you, for man was created weak.<br>
29. O ye who believe! Squander not your wealth among yourselves in vanity,<br>
except it be a trade by mutual consent, and kill not one another. Lo! Allah is<br>
ever Merciful unto you.<br>
30. Whoso doeth that through aggression and injustice, we shall cast him into<br>
Fire, and that is ever easy for Allah.<br>
31. If ye avoid the great [things] which ye are forbidden, We will remit from<br>
you your evil deeds and make you enter at a noble gate.<br>
32. And covet not the thing in which Allah hath made some of you excel others.<br>
Unto men a fortune from that which they have earned, and unto women a fortune<br>
from that which they have earned. [Envy not one another] but ask Allah of His<br>
bounty. Lo! Allah is ever Knower of all things.<br>
33. And unto each We have appointed heirs of that which parents and near kindred<br>
leave; and as for those with whom your right hands have made a covenant, give<br>
them their due. Lo! Allah is ever Witness over all things.<br>
34. Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel<br>
the other, and because they spend of their property [for the support of women].<br>
So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath<br>
guarded. As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them<br>
to beds apart, and scourge them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against<br>
them. Lo! Allah is ever High, Exalted, Great.<br>
35. And if ye fear a breach between them twain [the man and wife], appoint an<br>
arbiter from his folk and an arbiter from her folk. If they desire amendment<br>
Allah will make them of one mind. Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Aware.<br>
<br>
36<br>
<br>
36. And serve Allah. Ascribe no thing as partner unto Him. [Show] kindness unto<br>
parents, and unto near kindred, and orphans, and the needy, and unto the<br>
neighbour who is of kin [unto you] and the neighbour who is not of kin, and the<br>
fellow-traveller and the wayfarer and [the slaves] whom your right hands<br>
possess. Lo! Allah loveth not such as are proud and boastful,<br>
37. Who hoard their wealth and enjoin avarice on others, and hide that which<br>
Allah hath bestowed upon them of His bounty. For disbelievers We prepare a<br>
shameful doom;<br>
38. And [also] those who spend their wealth in order to be seen of men, and<br>
believe not in Allah nor the Last Day. Whoso taketh Satan for a comrade, a bad<br>
comrade hath he.<br>
39. What have they [to fear] if they believe in Allah and the Last Day and spend<br>
[aright] of that which Allah hath bestowed upon them, when Allah is ever Aware<br>
of them [and all they do]?<br>
40. Lo! Allah wrongeth not even of the weight of an ant; and if there is a good<br>
deed, He will double it and will give [the doer] from His presence an immense<br>
reward.<br>
41. But how [will it be with them] when We bring of every people a witness, and<br>
We bring thee [O Muhammad] a witness against these?<br>
42. On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish that<br>
they were level with the ground, and they can hide no fact from Allah.<br>
43. O ye who believe! Draw not near unto prayer when ye are drunken, till ye<br>
know that which ye utter, nor when ye are polluted, save when journeying upon<br>
the road, till ye have bathed. And if ye be ill, or on a journey, or one of you<br>
cometh from the closet, or ye have touched women, and ye find not water, then go<br>
to high clean soil and rub your faces and your hands [therewith]. Lo! Allah is<br>
Benign, Forgiving.<br>
44. Seest thou not those unto whom a portion of the Scripture hath been given,<br>
how they purchase error, and seek to make you [Muslims] err from the right way?<br>
45. Allah knoweth best [who are] your enemies. Allah is sufficient as a<br>
Guardian, and Allah is sufficient as a Supporter.<br>
46. Some of those who are Jews change words from their context and say: "We hear<br>
and disobey; hear thou as one who heareth not" and "Listen to us!" distorting<br>
with their tongues and slandering religion. If they had said: "We hear and we<br>
obey: hear thou, and look at us" it had been better for them, and more upright.<br>
But Allah hath cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, save a few.<br>
47. O ye unto whom the Scripture hath been given! Believe in what We have<br>
revealed confirming that which ye possess, before We destroy countenances so as<br>
to confound them, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers [of old time].<br>
The commandment of Allah is always executed.<br>
48. Lo! Allah forgiveth not that a partner should be ascribed unto Him. He<br>
forgiveth [all] save that to whom He will. Whoso ascribeth partners to Allah, he<br>
hath indeed invented a tremendous sin.<br>
49. Hast thou not seen those who praise themselves for purity? Nay, Allah<br>
purifieth whom He will, and they will not be wronged even the hair upon a datestone.<br>
50. See, how they invent lies about Allah! That of itself is flagrant sin.<br>
51. Hast thou not seen those unto whom a portion of the Scripture hath been<br>
given, how they believe in idols and false deities, and how they say of those<br>
37<br>
<br>
[idolaters] who disbelieve: "These are more rightly guided than those who<br>
believe"?<br>
52. Those are they whom Allah hath cursed, and he whom Allah hath cursed, thou<br>
[O Muhammad] wilt find for him no helper.<br>
53. Or have they even a share in the Sovereignty? Then in that case, they would<br>
not give mankind even the speck on a date-stone.<br>
54. Or are they jealous of mankind because of that which Allah of His bounty<br>
hath bestowed upon them? For We bestowed upon the house of Abraham [of old] the<br>
Scripture and wisdom, and We bestowed on them a mighty kingdom.<br>
55. And of them were [some] who believed therein and of them were [some] who<br>
turned away from it. Hell is sufficient for [their] burning.<br>
56. Lo! Those who disbelieve Our revelations, We shall expose them to the Fire.<br>
As often as their skins are consumed We shall exchange them for fresh skins that<br>
they may taste the torment. Lo! Allah is ever Mighty, Wise.<br>
57. And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall make them enter<br>
Gardens underneath which rivers flow - to dwell therein for ever; there for them<br>
are pure companions - and We shall make them enter plenteous shade.<br>
58. Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye restore deposits to their owners, and, if<br>
ye judge between mankind, that ye judge justly. Lo! comely is this which Allah<br>
admonisheth you. Lo! Allah is ever Hearer, Seer.<br>
59. O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the messenger and those of you who<br>
are in authority; and if ye have a dispute concerning any matter, refer it to<br>
Allah and the messenger if ye are [in truth] believers in Allah and the Last<br>
Day. That is better and more seemly in the end.<br>
60. Hast thou not seen those who pretend that they believe in that which is<br>
revealed unto thee and that which was revealed before thee, how they would go<br>
for judgment [in their disputes] to false deities when they have been ordered to<br>
abjure them? Satan would mislead them far astray.<br>
61. And when it is said unto them: Come unto that which Allah hath revealed and<br>
unto the messenger, thou seest the hypocrites turn from thee with aversion.<br>
62. How would it be if a misfortune smote them because of that which their own<br>
hands have sent before [them]? Then would they come unto thee, swearing by Allah<br>
that they were seeking naught but harmony and kindness.<br>
63. Those are they, the secrets of whose hearts Allah knoweth. So oppose them<br>
and admonish them, and address them in plain terms about their souls.<br>
64. We sent no messenger save that he should be obeyed by Allah's leave. And if,<br>
when they had wronged themselves, they had but come unto thee and asked<br>
forgiveness of Allah, and asked forgiveness of the messenger, they would have<br>
found Allah Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
65. But nay, by thy Lord, they will not believe [in truth] until they make thee<br>
judge of what is in dispute between them and find within themselves no dislike<br>
of that which thou decidest, and submit with full submission.<br>
66. And if We had decreed for them: Lay down your lives or go forth from your<br>
dwellings, but few of them would have done it; though if they did what they are<br>
exhorted to do it would be better for them, and more strengthening;<br>
67. And then We should bestow upon them from Our presence an immense reward,<br>
68. And should guide them unto a straight path.<br>
<br>
38<br>
<br>
69. Whoso obeyeth Allah and the messenger, they are with those unto whom Allah<br>
hath shown favour, of the prophets and the saints and the martyrs and the<br>
righteous. The best of company are they!<br>
70. That is bounty from Allah, and Allah sufficeth as Knower.<br>
71. O ye who believe! Take your precautions, then advance the proven ones, or<br>
advance all together.<br>
72. Lo! among you there is he who loitereth; and if disaster overtook you, he<br>
would say: Allah hath been gracious unto me since I was not present with them.<br>
73. And if a bounty from Allah befell you, he would surely cry, as if there had<br>
been no love between you and him: Oh, would that I had been with them, then<br>
should I have achieved a great success!<br>
74. Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the<br>
other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on<br>
him We shall bestow a vast reward.<br>
75. How should ye not fight for the cause of Allah and of the feeble among men<br>
and of the women and the children who are crying: Our Lord! Bring us forth from<br>
out this town of which the people are oppressors! Oh, give us from thy presence<br>
some protecting friend! Oh, give us from Thy presence some defender!<br>
76. Those who believe do battle for the cause of Allah; and those who disbelieve<br>
do battle for the cause of idols. So fight the minions of the devil. Lo! the<br>
devil's strategy is ever weak.<br>
77. Hast thou not seen those unto whom it was said: Withhold your hands,<br>
establish worship and pay the poordue, but when fighting was prescribed for them<br>
behold! a party of them fear mankind even as their fear of Allah or with greater<br>
fear, and say: Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordained fighting for us? If only Thou<br>
wouldst give us respite yet a while! Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: The comfort of<br>
this world is scant; the Hereafter will be better for him who wardeth off<br>
[evil]; and ye will not be wronged the down upon a date-stone.<br>
78. Wheresoever ye may be, death will overtake you, even though ye were in lofty<br>
towers. Yet if a happy thing befalleth them they say: This is from Allah; and if<br>
an evil thing befalleth them they say: This is of thy doing [O Muhammad]. Say<br>
[unto them]: All is from Allah. What is amiss with these people that they come<br>
not nigh to understand a happening?<br>
79. Whatever of good befalleth thee [O man] it is from Allah, and whatever of<br>
ill befalleth thee it is from thyself. We have sent thee [Muhammad] as a<br>
messenger unto mankind and Allah is sufficient as Witness.<br>
80. Whoso obeyeth the messenger hath obeyed Allah, and whoso turneth away: We<br>
have not sent thee as a warder over them.<br>
81. And they say: [It is] obedience; but when they have gone forth from thee a<br>
party of them spend the night in planning other than what thou sayest. Allah<br>
recordeth what they plan by night. So oppose them and put thy trust in Allah.<br>
Allah is sufficient as Trustee.<br>
82. Will they not then ponder on the Qur'an? If it had been from other than<br>
Allah they would have found therein much incongruity.<br>
83. And if any tidings, whether of safety or fear, come unto them, they noise it<br>
abroad, whereas if they had referred it to the messenger and to such of them as<br>
are in authority, those among them who are able to think out the matter would<br>
have known it. If it had not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy<br>
ye would have followed Satan, save a few [of you].<br>
<br>
39<br>
<br>
84. So fight [O Muhammad] in the way of Allah Thou art not taxed [with the<br>
responsibility for anyone] except thyself - and urge on the believers.<br>
Peradventure Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve. Allah is<br>
stronger in might and stronger in inflicting punishment.<br>
85. Whoso interveneth in a good cause will have the reward thereof, and whoso<br>
interveneth in an evil cause will bear the consequence thereof. Allah overseeth<br>
all things.<br>
86. When ye are greeted with a greeting, greet ye with a better than it or<br>
return it. Lo! Allah taketh count of all things.<br>
87. Allah! There is no Allah save Him. He gathereth you all unto a Day of<br>
Resurrection whereof there is no doubt. Who is more true in statement than<br>
Allah?<br>
88. What aileth you that ye are become two parties regarding the hypocrites,<br>
when Allah cast them back [to disbelief] because of what they earned? Seek ye to<br>
guide him whom Allah hath sent astray? He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him<br>
thou [O Muhammad] canst not find a road.<br>
89. They long that ye should disbelieve even as they disbelieve, that ye may be<br>
upon a level [with them]. So choose not friends from them till they forsake<br>
their homes in the way of Allah; if they turn back [to enmity] then take them<br>
and kill them wherever ye find them, and choose no friend nor helper from among<br>
them,<br>
90. Except those who seek refuge with a people between whom and you there is a<br>
covenant, or [those who] come unto you because their hearts forbid them to make<br>
war on you or make war on their own folk. Had Allah willed He could have given<br>
them power over you so that assuredly they would have fought you. So, if they<br>
hold aloof from you and wage not war against you and offer you peace, Allah<br>
alloweth you no way against them.<br>
91. Ye will find others who desire that they should have security from you, and<br>
security from their own folk. So often as they are returned to hostility they<br>
are plunged therein. If they keep not aloof from you nor offer you peace nor<br>
hold their hands, then take them and kill them wherever ye find them. Against<br>
such We have given you clear warrant.<br>
92. It is not for a believer to kill a believer unless [it be] by mistake. He<br>
who hath killed a believer by mistake must set free a believing slave, and pay<br>
the blood-money to the family of the slain, unless they remit it as a charity.<br>
If he [the victim] be of a people hostile unto you, and he is a believer, then<br>
[the penance is] to set free a believing slave. And if he cometh of a folk<br>
between whom and you there is a covenant, then the blood-money must be paid unto<br>
his folk and [also] a believing slave must be set free. And whoso hath not the<br>
wherewithal must fast two consecutive months. A penance from Allah. Allah is<br>
Knower, Wise.<br>
93. Whoso slayeth a believer of set purpose, his reward is hell for ever. Allah<br>
is wroth against him and He hath cursed him and prepared for him an awful doom.<br>
94. O ye who believe! When ye go forth [to fight] in the way of Allah, be<br>
careful to discriminate, and say not unto one who offereth you peace: "Thou art<br>
not a believer," seeking the chance profits of this life [so that ye may despoil<br>
him]. With Allah are plenteous spoils. Even thus [as he now is] were ye before;<br>
but Allah hath since then been gracious unto you. Therefore take care to<br>
discriminate. Allah is ever Informed of what ye do.<br>
95. Those of the believers who sit still, other than those who have a<br>
[disabling] hurt, are not on an equality with those who strive in the way of<br>
<br>
40<br>
<br>
Allah with their wealth and lives. Allah hath conferred on those who strive with<br>
their wealth and lives a rank above the sedentary. Unto each Allah hath promised<br>
good, but He hath bestowed on those who strive a great reward above the<br>
sedentary;<br>
96. Degrees of rank from Him, and forgiveness and mercy. Allah is ever<br>
Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
97. Lo! as for those whom the angels take [in death] while they wrong<br>
themselves, [the angels] will ask: In what were ye engaged? They will say: We<br>
were oppressed in the land. [The angels] will say: Was not Allah's earth<br>
spacious that ye could have migrated therein? As for such, their habitation will<br>
be hell, an evil journey's end;<br>
98. Except the feeble among men, and the women, and the children, who are unable<br>
to devise a plan and are not shown a way.<br>
99. As for such, it may be that Allah will pardon them. Allah is ever Clement,<br>
Forgiving.<br>
100. Whoso migrateth for the cause of Allah will find much refuge and abundance<br>
in the earth, and whoso forsaketh his home, a fugitive unto Allah and His<br>
messenger, and death overtaketh him, his reward is then incumbent on Allah.<br>
Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
101. And when ye go forth in the land, it is no sin for you to curtail [your]<br>
worship if ye fear that those who disbelieve may attack you. In truth the<br>
disbelievers are an open enemy to you.<br>
102. And when thou [O Muhammad] art among them and arrangest [their] worship for<br>
them, let only a party of them stand with thee [to worship] and let them take<br>
their arms. Then when they have performed their prostrations let them fall to<br>
the rear and let another party come that hath not worshipped and let them<br>
worship with thee, and let them take their precaution and their arms. Those who<br>
disbelieve long for you to neglect your arms and your baggage that they may<br>
attack you once for all. It is no sin for you to lay aside your arms, if rain<br>
impedeth you or ye are sick. But take your precaution. Lo! Allah prepareth for<br>
the disbelievers shameful punishment.<br>
103. When ye have performed the act of worship, remember Allah, standing,<br>
sitting and reclining. And when ye are in safety, observe proper worship.<br>
Worship at fixed times hath been enjoined on the believers.<br>
104. Relent not in pursuit of the enemy. If ye are suffering, lo! they suffer<br>
even as ye suffer and ye hope from Allah that for which they cannot hope. Allah<br>
is ever Knower, Wise.<br>
105. Lo! We reveal unto thee the Scripture with the truth, that thou mayst judge<br>
between mankind by that which Allah showeth thee. And be not thou a pleader for<br>
the treacherous;<br>
106. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
107. And plead not on behalf of [people] who deceive themselves. Lo! Allah<br>
loveth not one who is treacherous and sinful.<br>
108. They seek to hide from men and seek not to hide from Allah. He is with them<br>
when by night they hold discourse displeasing unto Him. Allah ever surroundeth<br>
what they do.<br>
109. Ho! ye are they who pleaded for them in the life of the world. But who will<br>
plead with Allah for them on the Day of Resurrection, or who will then be their<br>
defender?<br>
<br>
41<br>
<br>
110. Yet whoso doeth evil or wrongeth his own soul, then seeketh pardon of<br>
Allah, will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
111. Whoso committeth sin committeth it only against himself. Allah is ever<br>
Knower, Wise.<br>
112. And whoso committeth a delinquency or crime, then throweth [the blame]<br>
thereof upon the innocent, hath burdened himself with falsehood and a flagrant<br>
crime.<br>
113. But for the grace of Allah upon thee [Muhammad], and His mercy, a party of<br>
them had resolved to mislead thee, but they will mislead only themselves and<br>
they will hurt thee not at all. Allah revealeth unto thee the Scripture and<br>
wisdom, and teacheth thee that which thou knewest not. The grace of Allah toward<br>
thee hath been infinite.<br>
114. There is no good in much of their secret conferences save [in] him who<br>
enjoineth almsgiving and kindness and peace-making among the people. Whoso doeth<br>
that, seeking the good pleasure of Allah, We shall bestow on him a vast reward.<br>
115. And whoso opposeth the messenger after the guidance [of Allah] hath been<br>
manifested unto him, and followeth other than the believer's way, We appoint for<br>
him that unto which he himself hath turned, and expose him unto hell - a hapless<br>
journey's end!<br>
116. Lo! Allah pardoneth not that partners should be ascribed unto Him. He<br>
pardoneth all save that to whom He will. Whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah<br>
hath wandered far astray.<br>
117. They invoke in His stead only females; they pray to none else than Satan, a<br>
rebel<br>
118. Whom Allah cursed, and he said: Surely I will take of Thy bondmen an<br>
appointed portion,<br>
119. And surely I will lead them astray, and surely I will arouse desires in<br>
them, and surely I will command them and they will cut the cattle' ears, and<br>
surely I will command them and they will change Allah's creation. Whoso chooseth<br>
Satan for a patron instead of Allah is verily a loser and his loss is manifest.<br>
120. He promiseth them and stirreth up desires in them, and Satan promiseth them<br>
only to beguile.<br>
121. For such, their habitation will be hell, and they will find no refuge<br>
therefrom.<br>
122. But as for those who believe and do good works We shall bring them into<br>
Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever. It is a<br>
promise from Allah in truth; and who can be more truthful than Allah in<br>
utterance?<br>
123. It will not be in accordance with your desires, nor the desires of the<br>
People of the Scripture. He who doeth wrong will have the recompense thereof,<br>
and will not find against Allah any protecting friend or helper.<br>
124. And whoso doeth good works, whether of male or female, and he [or she] is a<br>
believer, such will enter paradise and they will not be wronged the dint in a<br>
date-stone.<br>
125. Who is better in religion than he who surrendereth his purpose to Allah<br>
while doing good [to men] and followeth the tradition of Abraham, the upright?<br>
Allah [Himself] chose Abraham for friend.<br>
<br>
42<br>
<br>
126. Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the<br>
earth. Allah ever surroundeth all things.<br>
127. They consult thee concerning women. Say: Allah giveth you decree concerning<br>
them, and the Scripture which hath been recited unto you [giveth decree],<br>
concerning female orphans and those unto whom ye give not that which is ordained<br>
for them though ye desire to marry them, and [concerning] the weak among<br>
children, and that ye should deal justly with orphans. Whatever good ye do, lo!<br>
Allah is ever Aware of it.<br>
128. If a woman feareth ill treatment from her husband, or desertion, it is no<br>
sin for them twain if they make terms of peace between themselves. Peace is<br>
better. But greed hath been made present in the minds [of men]. If ye do good<br>
and keep from evil, lo! Allah is ever Informed of what ye do.<br>
129. Ye will not be able to deal equally between [your] wives, however much ye<br>
wish [to do so]. But turn not altogether away [from one], leaving her as in<br>
suspense. If ye do good and keep from evil, lo! Allah is ever Forgiving,<br>
Merciful.<br>
130. But if they separate, Allah will compensate each out of His abundance.<br>
Allah is ever All-Embracing, All-Knowing.<br>
131. Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the<br>
earth. And We charged those who received the Scripture before you, and [We<br>
charge] you, that ye keep your duty toward Allah. And if ye disbelieve, lo! unto<br>
Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and<br>
Allah is ever Absolute, Owner of Praise.<br>
132. Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the<br>
earth. And Allah is sufficient as Defender.<br>
133. If He will, He can remove you, O people, and produce others [in your<br>
stead]. Allah is Able to do that.<br>
134. Whoso desireth the reward of the world, [let him know that] with Allah is<br>
the reward of the world and the Hereafter. Allah is ever Hearer, Seer.<br>
135. O ye who believe! Be ye staunch in justice, witnesses for Allah, even<br>
though it be against yourselves or [your] parents or [your] kindred, whether<br>
[the case be of] a rich man or a poor man, for Allah is nearer unto both [them<br>
ye are]. So follow not passion lest ye lapse [from truth] and if ye lapse or<br>
fall away, then lo! Allah is ever Informed of what ye do.<br>
136. O ye who believe! Believe in Allah and His messenger and the Scripture<br>
which He hath revealed unto His messenger, and the Scripture which He revealed<br>
aforetime. Whoso disbelieveth in Allah and His angels and His scriptures and His<br>
messengers and the Last Day, he verily hath wandered far astray.<br>
137. Lo! those who believe, then disbelieve and then [again] believe, then<br>
disbelieve, and then increase in disbelief, Allah will never pardon them, nor<br>
will He guide them unto a way.<br>
138. Bear unto the hypocrites the tidings that for them there is a painful doom;<br>
139. Those who chose disbelievers for their friends instead of believers! Do<br>
they look for power at their hands? Lo! all power appertaineth to Allah.<br>
140. He hath already revealed unto you in the Scripture that, when ye hear the<br>
revelations of Allah rejected and derided, [ye] sit not with them [who<br>
disbelieve and mock] until they engage in some other conversation. Lo! in that<br>
case [if ye stayed] ye would be like unto them. Lo! Allah will gather hypocrites<br>
and disbelievers, all together, into hell;<br>
<br>
43<br>
<br>
141. Those who wait upon occasion in regard to you and, if a victory cometh unto<br>
you from Allah, say: Are we not with you? and if the disbelievers meet with a<br>
success say: Had we not the mastery of you, and did we not protect you from the<br>
believers? - Allah will judge between you at the Day of Resurrection, and Allah<br>
will not give the disbelievers any way [of success] against the believers.<br>
142. Lo! the hypocrites seek to beguile Allah, but it is He Who beguileth them.<br>
When they stand up to worship they perform it languidly and to be seen of men,<br>
and are mindful of Allah but little;<br>
143. Swaying between this [and that], [belonging] neither to these nor to those.<br>
He whom Allah causeth to go astray, thou [O Muhammad] wilt not find a way for<br>
him:<br>
144. O ye who believe! Choose not disbelievers for [your] friends in place of<br>
believers. Would ye give Allah a clear warrant against you?<br>
145. Lo! the hypocrites [will be] in the lowest deep of the Fire, and thou wilt<br>
find no helper for them;<br>
146. Save those who repent and amend and hold fast to Allah and make their<br>
religion pure for Allah [only]. Those are with the believers. And Allah will<br>
bestow on the believers an immense reward.<br>
147. What concern hath Allah for your punishment if ye are thankful [for His<br>
mercies] and believe [in Him]? Allah was ever Responsive, Aware.<br>
148. Allah loveth not the utterance of harsh speech save by one who hath been<br>
wronged. Allah is ever Hearer, Knower.<br>
149. If ye do good openly or keep it secret, or forgive evil, lo! Allah is ever<br>
Forgiving, Powerful.<br>
150. Lo! those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers, and seek to make<br>
distinction between Allah and His messengers, and say: We believe in some and<br>
disbelieve in others, and seek to choose a way in between;<br>
151. Such are disbelievers in truth; and for disbelievers We prepare a shameful<br>
doom.<br>
152. But those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make no distinction<br>
between any of them, unto them Allah will give their wages; and Allah was ever<br>
Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
153. The people of the Scripture ask of thee that thou shouldst cause an<br>
[actual] Book to descend upon them from heaven. They asked a greater thing of<br>
Moses aforetime, for they said: Show us Allah plainly. The storm of lightning<br>
seized them for their wickedness. Then [even] after that] they chose the calf<br>
[for worship] after clear proofs [of Allah's Sovereignty] had come unto them.<br>
And We forgave them that! And We bestowed on Moses evident authority.<br>
154. And We caused the Mount to tower above them at [the taking of] their<br>
covenant: and We bade them: Enter the gate, prostrate! and We bode them:<br>
Transgress not the Sabbath! and We took from them a firm covenant.<br>
155. Then because of their breaking of their covenant, and their disbelieving in<br>
the revelations of Allah, and their slaying of the prophets wrongfully, and<br>
their saying: Our hearts are hardened - Nay, but Allah set a seal upon them for<br>
their disbelief, so that they believe not save a few 156. And because of their disbelief and of their speaking against Mary a<br>
tremendous calumny;<br>
<br>
44<br>
<br>
157. And because of their saying: We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary,<br>
Allah's messenger - they slew him not nor crucified him, but it appeared so unto<br>
them; and lo! those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof; they have<br>
no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture; they slew him not for<br>
certain.<br>
158. But Allah took him up unto Himself. Allah was ever Mighty, Wise.<br>
159. There is not one of the People of the Scripture but will believe in him<br>
before his death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against<br>
them 160. Because of the wrongdoing of the Jews We forbade them good things which<br>
were [before] made lawful unto them, and because of their much hindering from<br>
Allah's way,<br>
161. And of their taking usury when they were forbidden it, and of their<br>
devouring people's wealth by false pretences, We have prepared for those of them<br>
who disbelieve a painful doom.<br>
162. But those of them who are firm in knowledge and the believers believe in<br>
that which is revealed unto thee, and that which was revealed before thee,<br>
especially the diligent in prayer and those who pay the poor-due, the believers<br>
in Allah and the Last Day. Upon these We shall bestow immense reward.<br>
163. Lo! We inspire thee as We inspired Noah and the prophets after him, as We<br>
inspired Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and Jesus and<br>
Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and as We imparted unto David the Psalms;<br>
164. And messengers We have mentioned unto thee before and messengers We have<br>
not mentioned unto thee; and Allah spake directly unto Moses;<br>
165. Messengers of good cheer and of warning, in order that mankind might have<br>
no argument against Allah after the messengers. Allah was ever Mighty, Wise.<br>
166. But Allah [Himself] testifieth concerning that which He hath revealeth unto<br>
thee; in His knowledge hath He revealed it; and the angels also testify. And<br>
Allah is sufficient Witness.<br>
167. Lo! those who disbelieve and hinder [others] from the way of Allah, they<br>
verily have wandered far astray.<br>
168. Lo! those who disbelieve and deal in wrong, Allah will never forgive them,<br>
neither will He guide them unto a road,<br>
169. Except the road of hell, wherein they will abide for ever. And that is ever<br>
easy for Allah.<br>
170. O mankind! The messenger hath come unto you with the Truth from your Lord.<br>
Therefor believe; [it is] better for you. But if ye disbelieve, still, lo! unto<br>
Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. Allah is ever<br>
Knower, Wise.<br>
171. O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion nor utter<br>
aught concerning Allah save the truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only<br>
a messenger of Allah, and His word which He conveyed unto Mary, and a spirit<br>
from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and say not "Three" - Cease!<br>
[it is] better for you! - Allah is only One Allah. Far is it removed from His<br>
Transcendent Majesty that He should have a son. His is all that is in the<br>
heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is sufficient as Defender.<br>
172. The Messiah will never scorn to be a slave unto Allah, nor will the<br>
favoured angels. Whoso scorneth His service and is proud, all such will He<br>
assemble unto Him;<br>
45<br>
<br>
173. Then, as for those who believed and did<br>
their wages in full, adding unto them of His<br>
scornful and proud, them will He punish with<br>
find for them, against Allah, any protecting<br>
<br>
good works, unto them will He pay<br>
bounty; and as for those who were<br>
a painful doom. And they will not<br>
friend or helper.<br>
<br>
174. O mankind! Now hath a proof from your Lord come unto you, and We have sent<br>
down unto you a clear light;<br>
175. As for those who believe in Allah, and hold fast unto Him, them He will<br>
cause to enter into His mercy and grace, and will guide them unto Him by a<br>
straight road.<br>
176. They ask thee for a pronouncement. Say: Allah hath pronounced for you<br>
concerning distant kindred. If a man die childless and he have a sister, hers is<br>
half the heritage, and he would have inherited from her had she died childless.<br>
And if there be two sisters, then theirs are two-thirds of the heritage, and if<br>
they be brethren, men and women, unto the male is the equivalent of the share of<br>
two females. Allah expoundeth unto you, so that ye err not. Allah is Knower of<br>
all things.<br>
<br>
SURA 5. AL-MAEDA (THE TABLE, THE TABLE SPREAD)<br>
1. O ye who believe! Fulfil your indentures.<br>
2. The beast of cattle is made lawful unto you [for food] except that which is<br>
announced unto you [herein], game being unlawful when ye are on the pilgrimage.<br>
Lo! Allah ordaineth that which pleaseth Him.<br>
3. O ye who believe! Profane not Allah's monuments nor the Sacred Month nor the<br>
offerings nor the garlands, nor those repairing to the Sacred House, seeking the<br>
grace and pleasure of their Lord. But when ye have left the sacred territory,<br>
then go hunting [if ye will]. And let not your hatred of a folk who [once]<br>
stopped your going to the inviolable place of worship seduce you to transgress;<br>
but help ye one another unto righteousness and pious duty. Help not one another<br>
unto sin and transgression, but keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is severe in<br>
punishment.<br>
4. Forbidden unto you [for food] are carrion and blood and swineflesh, and that<br>
which hath been dedicated unto any other than Allah, and the strangled, and the<br>
dead through beating, and the dead through falling from a height, and that which<br>
hath been killed by [the goring of] horns, and the devoured of wild beasts,<br>
saving that which ye make lawful [by the death-stroke], and that which hath been<br>
immolated unto idols. And [forbidden is it] that ye swear by the divining<br>
arrows. This is an abomination. This day are those who disbelieve in despair of<br>
[ever harming] your religion; so fear them not, fear Me! This day have I<br>
perfected your religion for you and completed My favour unto you, and have<br>
chosen for you as religion al-Islam. Whoso is forced by hunger, not by will, to<br>
sin: [for him] lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
5. They ask thee [O Muhammad] what is made lawful for them. Say: [all] good<br>
things are made lawful for you. And those beasts and birds of prey which ye have<br>
trained as hounds are trained, ye teach them that which Allah taught you; so eat<br>
of that which they catch for you and mention Allah's name upon it, and observe<br>
your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is swift to take account.<br>
6. This day are [all] good things made lawful for you. The food of those who<br>
have received the Scripture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them.<br>
And so are the virtuous women of the believers and the virtuous women of those<br>
who received the Scripture before you [lawful for you] when ye give them their<br>
<br>
46<br>
<br>
marriage portions and live with them in honour, not in fornication, nor taking<br>
them as secret concubines. Whoso denieth the faith, his work is vain and he will<br>
be among the losers in the Hereafter.<br>
7. O ye who believe! When ye rise up for prayer, wash you faces, and your hands<br>
up to the elbows, and lightly rub your heads and [wash] your feet up to the<br>
ankles. And if ye are unclean, purify yourselves. And if ye are sick or on a<br>
journey, or one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have had contact with<br>
women, and ye find not water, then go to clean, high ground and rub your faces<br>
and your hands with some of it. Allah would not place a burden on you, but He<br>
would purify you and would perfect His grace upon you, that ye may give thanks.<br>
8. Remember Allah's grace upon you and His covenant by which He bound you when<br>
ye said: We hear and we obey; And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! He knoweth what<br>
is in the breasts [of men].<br>
9. O ye who believe! Be steadfast witnesses for Allah in equity, and let not<br>
hatred of any people seduce you that ye deal not justly. Deal justly, that is<br>
nearer to your duty. Observe your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is Informed of what<br>
ye do.<br>
10. Allah hath promised those who believe and do good works: Theirs will be<br>
forgiveness and immense reward.<br>
11. And they who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, such are rightful owners<br>
of hell.<br>
12. O ye who believe! Remember Allah's favour unto you, how a people were minded<br>
to stretch out their hands against you but He withheld their hands from you; and<br>
keep your duty to Allah. In Allah let believers put their trust.<br>
13. Allah made a covenant of old with the Children of Israel and We raised among<br>
them twelve chieftains, and Allah said: Lo! I am with you. If ye establish<br>
worship and pay the poor-due, and believe in My messengers and support them, and<br>
lend unto Allah a kindly loan, surely I shall remit your sins, and surely I<br>
shall bring you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow. Whoso among you<br>
disbelieveth after this will go astray from a plain road.<br>
14. And because of their breaking their covenant, We have cursed them and made<br>
hard their hearts. They change words from their context and forget a part of<br>
that whereof they were admonished. Thou wilt not cease to discover treachery<br>
from all save a few of them. But bear with them and pardon them. Lo! Allah<br>
loveth the kindly.<br>
15. And with those who say: "Lo! we are Christians," We made a covenant, but<br>
they forgot a part of that whereof they were admonished. Therefor We have<br>
stirred up enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection, when Allah<br>
will inform them of their handiwork.<br>
16. O People of the Scripture! Now hath Our messenger come unto you, expounding<br>
unto you much of that which ye used to hide in the Scripture, and forgiving<br>
much.<br>
17. Now hath come unto you light from Allah and plain Scripture,<br>
18. Whereby Allah guideth him who seeketh His good pleasure unto paths of peace.<br>
He bringeth them out of darkness unto light by His decree, and guideth them unto<br>
a straight path.<br>
19. They indeed have disbelieved who say: Lo! Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary.<br>
Say: Who then can do aught against Allah, if He had willed to destroy the<br>
Messiah son of Mary, and his mother and everyone on earth? Allah's is the<br>
<br>
47<br>
<br>
Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. He<br>
createth what He will. And Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
20. The Jews and Christians say: We are sons of Allah and His loved ones. Say:<br>
Why then doth He chastise you for your sins? Nay, ye are but mortals of His<br>
creating. He forgiveth whom He will, and chastiseth whom He will. Allah's is the<br>
Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, and unto<br>
Him is the journeying.<br>
21. O People of the Scripture! Now hath Our messenger come unto you to make<br>
things plain unto you after an interval [of cessation] of the messengers, lest<br>
ye should say: There came not unto us a messenger of cheer nor any warner. Now<br>
hath a messenger of cheer and a warner come unto you. Allah is Able to do all<br>
things.<br>
22. And [remember] when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Remember<br>
Allah's favour unto you, how He placed among you prophets, and He made you<br>
kings, and gave you that [which] He gave not to any [other] of [His] creatures.<br>
23. O my people! Go into the holy land which Allah hath ordained for you. Turn<br>
not in flight, for surely ye turn back as losers:<br>
24. They said: O Moses! Lo! a giant people [dwell] therein and lo! we go not in<br>
till they go forth from thence. When they go forth from thence, then we will<br>
enter [not till then].<br>
25. Then out spake two of those who feared [their Lord, men] unto whom Allah had<br>
been gracious: Enter in upon them by the gate, for if ye enter by it, lo! ye<br>
will be victorious.<br>
26. So put your trust [in Allah] if ye are indeed believers.<br>
27. They said: O Moses! We will never enter [the land] while they are in it. So<br>
go thou and thy Lord and fight! We will sit here.<br>
28. He said: My Lord! I have control of none but myself and my brother, so<br>
distinguish between us and the wrong-doing folk.<br>
29. [Their Lord] said: For this the land will surely be forbidden them for forty<br>
years that they will wander in the earth, bewildered. So grieve not over the<br>
wrongdoing folk.<br>
30. But recite unto them with truth the tale of the two sons of Adam, how they<br>
offered each a sacrifice, and it was accepted from the one of them and it was<br>
not accepted from the other. [The one] said: I will surely kill thee. [The<br>
other] answered: Allah accepteth only from those who ward off [evil].<br>
31. Even if thou stretch out thy hand against me to kill me, I shall not stretch<br>
out my hand against thee to kill thee, lo! I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.<br>
32. Lo! I would rather thou shouldst bear the punishment of the sin against me<br>
and thine own sin and become one of the owners of the fire. That is the reward<br>
of evil-doers.<br>
33. But [the other's] mind imposed on him the killing of his brother, so he slew<br>
him and became one of the losers.<br>
34. Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground, to show him how to hide<br>
his brother's naked corpse. He said: Woe unto me! Am I not able to be as this<br>
raven and so hide my brother's naked corpse? And he became repentant.<br>
35. For that cause We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever killeth<br>
a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall<br>
be as if he had killed all mankind, and whoso saveth the life of one, it shall<br>
<br>
48<br>
<br>
be as if he had saved the life of all mankind. Our messengers came unto them of<br>
old with clear proofs [of Allah's Sovereignty], but afterwards lo! many of them<br>
became prodigals in the earth.<br>
36. The only reward of those who make war upon Allah and His messenger and<br>
strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or<br>
crucified, or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off, or will be<br>
expelled out of the land. Such will be their degradation in the world, and in<br>
the Hereafter theirs will be an awful doom;<br>
37. Save those who repent before ye overpower them. For know that Allah is<br>
Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
38. O ye who believe! Be mindful of your duty to Allah, and seek the way of<br>
approach unto Him, and strive in His way in order that ye may succeed.<br>
39. As for those who disbelieve, lo! if all that is in the earth were theirs,<br>
and as much again therewith, to ransom them from the doom on the Day of<br>
Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them. Theirs will be a painful doom.<br>
40. They will wish to come forth from the Fire, but they will not come forth<br>
from it. Theirs will be a lasting doom.<br>
41. As for the thief, both male and female, cut off their hands. It is the<br>
reward of their own deeds, an exemplary punishment from Allah. Allah is Mighty,<br>
Wise.<br>
42. But whoso repenteth after his wrongdoing and amendeth, lo! Allah will relent<br>
toward him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
43. Knowest thou not that unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens<br>
and the earth? He punisheth whom He will, and forgiveth whom He will. Allah is<br>
Able to do all things.<br>
44. O Messenger! Let not them grieve thee who vie one with another in the race<br>
to disbelief, of such as say with their mouths: "We believe," but their hearts<br>
believe not, and of the Jews: listeners for the sake of falsehood, listeners on<br>
behalf of other folk who come not unto thee, changing words from their context<br>
and saying: If this be given unto you, receive it, but if this be not given unto<br>
you, then beware! He whom Allah doometh unto sin, thou [by thine efforts] wilt<br>
avail him naught against Allah. Those are they for whom the Will of Allah is<br>
that He cleanse not their hearts. Theirs in the world will be ignominy, and in<br>
the Hereafter an awful doom;<br>
45. Listeners for the sake of falsehood! Greedy for illicit gain! If then they<br>
have recourse unto thee [Muhammad] judge between them or disclaim jurisdiction.<br>
If thou disclaimest jurisdiction, then they cannot harm thee at all. But if thou<br>
judgest, judge between them with equity. Lo! Allah loveth the equitable.<br>
46. How come they unto thee for judgment when they have the Torah, wherein Allah<br>
hath delivered judgment [for them]? Yet even after that they turn away. Such<br>
[folk] are not believers.<br>
47. Lo! We did reveal the Torah, wherein is guidance and a light, by which the<br>
prophets who surrendered [unto Allah] judged the Jews, and the rabbis and the<br>
priests [judged] by such of Allah's Scripture as they were bidden to observe,<br>
and thereunto were they witnesses. So fear not mankind, but fear Me. And My<br>
revelations for a little gain. Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath<br>
revealed: such are disbelievers.<br>
48. And We prescribed for them therein: The life for the life, and the eye for<br>
the eye, and the nose for the nose, and the ear for the ear, and the tooth for<br>
the tooth, and for wounds retaliation. But whoso forgoeth it [in the way of<br>
<br>
49<br>
<br>
charity] it shall be expiation for him. Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah<br>
hath revealed: such are wrong-doers.<br>
49. And We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming<br>
that which was [revealed] before him in the Torah, and We bestowed on him the<br>
Gospel wherein is guidance and a light, confirming that which was [revealed]<br>
before it in the Torah - a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off<br>
[evil].<br>
50. Let the People of the Gospel judge by that which Allah hath revealed<br>
therein. Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed: such are evillivers.<br>
51. And unto thee have We revealed the Scripture with the truth, confirming<br>
whatever Scripture was before it, and a watcher over it. So judge between them<br>
by that which Allah hath revealed, and follow not their desires away from the<br>
truth which hath come unto thee. For each We have appointed a divine law and a<br>
traced-out way. Had Allah willed He could have made you one community. But that<br>
He may try you by that which He hath given you [He hath made you as ye are]. So<br>
vie one with another in good works. Unto Allah ye will all return, and He will<br>
then inform you of that wherein ye differ.<br>
52. So judge between them by that which Allah hath revealed, and follow not<br>
their desires, but beware of them lest they seduce thee from some part of that<br>
which Allah hath revealed unto thee. And if they turn away, then know that<br>
Allah's Will is to smite them for some sin of theirs. Lo! many of mankind are<br>
evil-livers.<br>
53. Is it a judgment of the time of [pagan] ignorance that they are seeking? Who<br>
is better than Allah for judgment to a people who have certainty [in their<br>
belief]?<br>
54. O ye who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians for friends. They are<br>
friends one to another. He among you who taketh them for friends is [one] of<br>
them. Lo! Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.<br>
55. And thou seest those in whose heart is a disease race toward them, saying:<br>
We fear lest a change of fortune befall us. And it may happen that Allah will<br>
vouchsafe [unto thee] the victory, or a commandment from His presence. Then will<br>
they repent them of their secret thoughts.<br>
56. Then will the believers say [unto the people of the Scripture]: are these<br>
they who swore by Allah their most binding oaths that they were surely with you?<br>
Their works have failed, and they have become the losers.<br>
57. O ye who believe! Whoso of you becometh a renegade from his religion, [know<br>
that in his stead] Allah will bring a people whom He loveth and who love Him,<br>
humble toward believers, stern toward disbelievers, striving in the way of<br>
Allah, and fearing not the blame of any blamer. Such is the grace of Allah which<br>
He giveth unto whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.<br>
58. Your guardian can be only Allah; and His messenger and those who believe,<br>
who establish worship and pay the poordue, and bow down [in prayer].<br>
59. And whoso taketh Allah and His messenger and those who believe for guardian<br>
[will know that], lo! the party of Allah, they are the victorious.<br>
60. O Ye who believe! Choose not for guardians such of those who received the<br>
Scripture before you, and of the disbelievers, as make a jest and sport of your<br>
religion. But keep your duty to Allah if ye are true believers.<br>
61. And when ye call to prayer they take it for a jest and sport. That is<br>
because they are a folk who understand not.<br>
<br>
50<br>
<br>
62. Say: O People of the Scripture! Do ye blame us for aught else than that we<br>
believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed<br>
aforetime, and because most of you are evil-livers?<br>
63. Shall I tell thee of a worse [case] than theirs for retribution with Allah?<br>
[Worse is the case of him] whom Allah hath cursed, him on whom His wrath hath<br>
fallen and of whose sort Allah hath turned some to apes and swine, and who<br>
serveth idols. Such are in worse plight and further astray from the plain road.<br>
64. When they come unto you [Muslims], they say: We believe; but they came in<br>
unbelief and they went out in the same; and Allah knoweth best what they were<br>
hiding.<br>
65. And thou seest many of them vying one with another in sin and transgression<br>
and their devouring of illicit gain. Verily evil is what they do.<br>
66. Why do not the rabbis and the priests forbid their evil-speaking and their<br>
devouring of illicit gain? Verily evil is their handiwork.<br>
67. The Jews say: Allah's hand is fettered. Their hands are fettered and they<br>
are accursed for saying so. Nay, but both His hands are spread out wide in<br>
bounty. He bestoweth as He will. That which hath been revealed unto thee from<br>
thy Lord is certain to increase the contumacy and disbelief of many of them, and<br>
We have cast among them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection. As often<br>
as they light a fire for war, Allah extinguisheth it. Their effort is for<br>
corruption in the land, and Allah loveth not corrupters.<br>
68. If only the People of the Scripture would believe and ward off [evil],<br>
surely We should remit their sins from them and surely We should bring them into<br>
Gardens of Delight.<br>
69. If they had observed the Torah and the Gospel and that which was revealed<br>
unto them from their Lord, they would surely have been nourished from above them<br>
and from beneath their feet. Among them there are people who are moderate, but<br>
many of them are of evil conduct.<br>
70. O Messenger! Make known that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy<br>
Lord, for if thou do it not, thou wilt not have conveyed His message. Allah will<br>
protect thee from mankind. Lo! Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk.<br>
71. Say O People of the Scripture! Ye have naught [of guidance] till ye observe<br>
the Torah and the Gospel and that which was revealed unto you from your Lord.<br>
That which is revealed unto thee [Muhammad] from thy Lord is certain to increase<br>
the contumacy and disbelief of many of them. But grieve not for the disbelieving<br>
folk.<br>
72. Lo! those who believe, and those who are Jews, and Sabaeans, and Christians<br>
- Whosoever believeth in Allah and the Last Day and doeth right - there shall no<br>
fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.<br>
73. We made a covenant of old with the Children of Israel and We sent unto them<br>
messengers. As often as a messenger came unto them with that which their souls<br>
desired not [they became rebellious]. Some [of them] they denied and some they<br>
slew.<br>
74. They thought no harm would come of it, so they were wilfully blind and deaf.<br>
And afterward Allah turned [in mercy] toward them. Now [even after that] are<br>
many of them wilfully blind and deaf. Allah is Seer of what they do.<br>
75. They surely disbelieve who say: Lo! Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary. The<br>
Messiah [himself] said: O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your<br>
Lord. Lo! whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah, for him Allah hath forbidden<br>
paradise. His abode is the Fire. For evil-doers there will be no helpers.<br>
<br>
51<br>
<br>
76. They surely disbelieve who say: Lo! Allah is the third of three; when there<br>
is no Allah save the One Allah. If they desist not from so saying a painful doom<br>
will fall on those of them who disbelieve.<br>
77. Will they not rather turn unto Allah and seek forgiveness of Him? For Allah<br>
is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
78. The Messiah, son of Mary, was no other than a messenger, messengers [the<br>
like of whom] had passed away before him. And his mother was a saintly woman.<br>
And they both used to eat [earthly] food. See how We make the revelations clear<br>
for them, and see how they are turned away!<br>
79. Say: Serve ye in place of Allah that which possesseth for you neither hurt<br>
nor use? Allah it is Who is the Hearer, the Knower.<br>
80. Say: O People of the Scripture! Stress not in your religion other than the<br>
truth, and follow not the vain desires of folk who erred of old and led many<br>
astray, and erred from a plain road.<br>
81. Those of the Children of Israel who went astray were cursed by the tongue of<br>
David, and of Jesus, son of Mary. That was because they rebelled and used to<br>
transgress.<br>
82. They restrained not one another from the wickedness they did. Verily evil<br>
was that they used to do!<br>
83. Thou seest many of them making friends with those who disbelieve. Surely ill<br>
for them is that which they themselves send on before them: that Allah will be<br>
wroth with them and in the doom they will abide.<br>
84. If they believed in Allah and the Prophet and that which is revealed unto<br>
him, they would not choose them for their friends. But many of them are of evil<br>
conduct.<br>
85. Thou wilt find the most vehement of mankind in hostility to those who<br>
believe [to be] the Jews and the idolaters. And thou wilt find the nearest of<br>
them in affection to those who believe [to be] those who say: Lo! We are<br>
Christians. That is because there are among them priests and monks, and because<br>
they are not proud.<br>
86. When they listen to that which hath been revealed unto the messengers, thou<br>
seest their eyes overflow with tears because of their recognition of the Truth.<br>
They say: Our Lord, we believe. Inscribe us as among the witnesses.<br>
87. How should we not believe in Allah and that which hath come unto us of the<br>
Truth. And [how should we not] hope that our Lord will bring us in along with<br>
righteous folk?<br>
88. Allah hath rewarded them for that their saying - Gardens underneath which<br>
rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the reward of the good.<br>
89. But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, they are owners of hellfire.<br>
90. O ye who believe! Forbid not the good things which Allah hath made lawful<br>
for you, and transgress not, Lo! Allah loveth not transgressors.<br>
91. Eat of that which Allah hath bestowed on you as food lawful and good, and<br>
keep your duty to Allah in Whom ye are believers.<br>
92. Allah will not take you to task<br>
oaths, but He will take you to task<br>
expiation thereof is the feeding of<br>
wherewith ye feed your own folk, or<br>
<br>
for<br>
for<br>
ten<br>
the<br>
<br>
that which is unintentional in your<br>
the oaths which ye swear in earnest. The<br>
of the needy with the average of that<br>
clothing of them, or the liberation of a<br>
<br>
52<br>
<br>
slave, and for him who findeth not [the wherewithal to do so] then a three days'<br>
fast. This is the expiation of your oaths when ye have sworn; and keep your<br>
oaths. Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations in order that ye may give<br>
thanks.<br>
93. O ye who believe! Strong drink and games of chance and idols and divining<br>
arrows are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork. Leave it aside in order that ye<br>
may succeed.<br>
94. Satan seeketh only to cast among you enmity and hatred by means of strong<br>
drink and games of chance, and to turn you from remembrance of Allah and from<br>
[His] worship. Will ye then have done?<br>
95. Obey Allah and obey the messenger, and beware! But if ye turn away, then<br>
know that the duty of Our messenger is only plain conveyance [of the message].<br>
96. There shall be no sin [imputed] unto those who believe and do good works for<br>
what they may have eaten [in the past]. So be mindful of your duty [to Allah],<br>
and believe, and do good works; and again: be mindful of your duty, and believe;<br>
and once again: be mindful of your duty, and do right. Allah loveth the good.<br>
97. O ye who believe! Allah will surely try you somewhat [in the matter] of the<br>
game which ye take with your hands and your spears, that Allah may know him who<br>
feareth Him in secret. Whoso transgresseth after this, for him there is a<br>
painful doom.<br>
98. O ye who believe! Kill no wild game while ye are on the pilgrimage. Whoso of<br>
you killeth it of set purpose he shall pay its forfeit in the equivalent of that<br>
which he hath killed, of domestic animals, the judge to be two men among you<br>
known for justice, [the forfeit] to be brought as an offering to the Ka'bah; or,<br>
for expiation, he shall feed poor persons, or the equivalent thereof in fasting,<br>
that he may taste the evil consequences of his deed. Allah forgiveth whatever<br>
[of this kind] may have happened in the past, but whoso relapseth, Allah will<br>
take retribution from him. Allah is Mighty, Able to Requite [the wrong].<br>
99. To hunt and to eat the fish of the sea is made lawful for you, a provision<br>
for you and for seafarers; but to hunt on land is forbidden you so long as ye<br>
are on the pilgrimage. Be mindful of your duty to Allah, unto Whom ye will be<br>
gathered.<br>
100. Allah hath appointed the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, a standard for mankind,<br>
and the Sacred Month and the offerings and the garlands. That is so that ye may<br>
know that Allah knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the<br>
earth, and that Allah is Knower of all things.<br>
101. Know that Allah is severe in punishment, but that Allah [also] is<br>
Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
102. The duty of the messenger is only to convey [the message]. Allah knoweth<br>
what ye proclaim and what ye hide.<br>
103. Say: The evil and the good are not alike even though the plenty of the evil<br>
attract thee. So be mindful of your duty to Allah, O men of understanding, that<br>
ye may succeed.<br>
104. O ye who believe! Ask not of things which, if they were made unto you,<br>
would trouble you; but if ye ask of them when the Qur'an is being revealed, they<br>
will be made known unto you. Allah pardoneth this, for Allah is Forgiving,<br>
Clement.<br>
105. A folk before you asked [for such disclosures] and then disbelieved<br>
therein.<br>
<br>
53<br>
<br>
106. Allah hath not appointed anything in the nature of a Bahirah or a Sa'ibah<br>
or a Wasilah or a Hami, but those who disbelieve invent a lie against Allah.<br>
Most of them have no sense.<br>
107. And when it is said unto them: Come unto that which Allah hath revealed and<br>
unto the messenger, they say: Enough for us is that wherein we found our<br>
fathers. What! Even though their fathers had no knowledge whatsoever, and no<br>
guidance?<br>
108. O ye who believe! Ye have charge of your own souls. He who erreth cannot<br>
injure you if ye are rightly guided. Unto Allah ye will all return; and then He<br>
will inform you of what ye used to do.<br>
109. O ye who believe! Let there be witnesses between you when death draweth<br>
nigh unto one of you, at the time of bequest - two witnesses, just men from<br>
among you, or two others from another tribe, in case ye are campaigning in the<br>
land and the calamity of death befall you. Ye shall empanel them both after the<br>
prayer, and, if ye doubt, they shall be made to swear by Allah [saying]: We will<br>
not take a bribe, even though it were [on behalf of] a near kinsman nor will we<br>
hide the testimony of Allah, for then indeed we should be of the sinful.<br>
110. But then, if it is afterwards ascertained that both of them merit [the<br>
suspicion of] sin, let two others take their place of those nearly concerned,<br>
and let them swear by Allah, [saying]: Verily our testimony is truer than their<br>
testimony and we have not transgressed [the bounds of duty], for them indeed we<br>
should be of the evil-doers.<br>
111. Thus it is more likely that they will bear true witness or fear that after<br>
their oaths the oaths [of others] will be taken. So be mindful of your duty [to<br>
Allah] and hearken. Allah guideth not the froward folk.<br>
112. In the day when Allah gathereth together the messengers, and saith: What<br>
was your response [from mankind]? they say: We have no knowledge. Lo! Thou, only<br>
Thou art the Knower of Things Hidden,<br>
113. When Allah saith: O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favour unto thee and<br>
unto thy mother; how I strengthened thee with the holy Spirit, so that thou<br>
spakest unto mankind in the cradle as in maturity; and how I taught thee the<br>
Scripture and Wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and how thou didst shape of<br>
clay as it were the likeness of a bird by My permission, and didst blow upon it<br>
and it was a bird by My permission, and thou didst heal him who was born blind<br>
and the leper by My permission; and how thou didst raise the dead by My<br>
permission; and how I restrained the Children of Israel from [harming] thee when<br>
thou camest unto them with clear proofs, and those of them who disbelieved<br>
exclaimed: This is naught else than mere magic;<br>
114. And when I inspired the disciples, [saying]: Believe in Me and in My<br>
messenger, they said: We believe. Bear witness that we have surrendered [unto<br>
Thee] "we are muslims".<br>
115. When the disciples said: O Jesus, son of Mary! Is thy Lord able to send<br>
down for us a table spread with food from heaven? He said: Observe your duty to<br>
Allah, if ye are true believers.<br>
116. [They said:] We wish to eat thereof, that we may satisfy our hearts and<br>
know that thou hast spoken truth to us, and that thereof we may be witnesses.<br>
117. Jesus,<br>
spread with<br>
and for the<br>
the Best of<br>
<br>
son of Mary, said: O Allah, Lord of us! Send down for us a table<br>
food from heaven, that it may be a feast for us, for the first of us<br>
last of us, and a sign from Thee. Give us sustenance, for Thou art<br>
Sustainers.<br>
<br>
54<br>
<br>
118. Allah said: Lo! I send it down for you. And whoso disbelieveth of you<br>
afterward, him surely will I punish with a punishment wherewith I have not<br>
punished any of [My] creatures.<br>
119. And when Allah saith: O Jesus, son of Mary! Didst thou say unto mankind:<br>
Take me and my mother for two gods beside Allah? he saith: Be glorified! It was<br>
not mine to utter that to which I had no right. If I used to say it, then Thou<br>
knewest it. Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I know not what is in Thy Mind.<br>
Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower of Things Hidden?<br>
120. I spake unto them only that which Thou commandedst me, [saying]: Worship<br>
Allah, my Lord and your Lord. I was a witness of them while I dwelt among them,<br>
and when Thou tookest me Thou wast the Watcher over them. Thou art Witness over<br>
all things.<br>
121. If Thou punish them, lo! they are Thy slaves, and if Thou forgive them [lo!<br>
they are Thy slaves]. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
122. Allah saith: This is a day in which their truthfulness profiteth the<br>
truthful, for theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they are<br>
secure for ever, Allah taking pleasure in them and they in Him. That is the<br>
great triumph.<br>
123. Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and<br>
whatsoever is therein, and He is Able to do all things.<br>
<br>
SURA 6. AL-ANAAM (CATTLE, LIVESTOCK)<br>
1. Praise be to Allah, Who hath created the heavens and the earth, and hath<br>
appointed darkness and light. Yet those who disbelieve ascribe rivals unto their<br>
Lord.<br>
2. He it is Who hath created you from clay, and hath decreed a term for you. A<br>
term is fixed with Him. Yet still ye doubt!<br>
3. He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth. He knoweth both your secret and<br>
your utterance, and He knoweth what ye earn.<br>
4. Never came there unto them a revelation of the revelations of Allah but they<br>
did turn away from it.<br>
5. And they denied the truth when it came unto them. But there will come unto<br>
them the tidings of that which they used to deride.<br>
6. See they not how many a generation We destroyed before them, whom We had<br>
established in the earth more firmly than We have established you, and We shed<br>
on them abundant showers from the sky, and made the rivers flow beneath them.<br>
Yet we destroyed them for their sins, and created after them another generation.<br>
7. Had we sent down unto thee [Muhammad] [actual] writing upon parchment, so<br>
that they could feel it with their hands, those who disbelieve would have said:<br>
This is naught else than mere magic.<br>
8. They say: Why hath not an angel been sent down unto him? If We sent down an<br>
angel, then the matter would be judged; no further time would be allowed them<br>
[for reflection].<br>
9. Had we appointed him [Our messenger] an angel, We assuredly had made him [as]<br>
a man [that he might speak to men]; and [thus] obscured for them [the truth]<br>
they [now] obscure.<br>
<br>
55<br>
<br>
10. Messengers [of Allah] have been derided before thee, but that whereat they<br>
scoffed surrounded such of them as did deride.<br>
11. Say [unto the disbelievers]: Travel in the land, and see the nature of the<br>
consequence for the rejecters!<br>
12. Say: Unto whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth? Say:<br>
Unto Allah. He hath prescribed for Himself mercy, that He may bring you all<br>
together to the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt. Those who ruin<br>
their souls will not believe.<br>
13. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever resteth in the night and the day. He is the<br>
Hearer, the Knower.<br>
14. Say: Shall I choose for a protecting friend other than Allah, the Originator<br>
of the heavens and the earth, Who feedeth and is never fed? Say: I am ordered to<br>
be the first to surrender [unto Him]. And be not thou [O Muhammad] of the<br>
idolaters.<br>
15. Say: I fear, if I rebel against my Lord, the retribution of an Awful Day.<br>
16. He from whom [such retribution] is averted on that day, [Allah] hath in<br>
truth had mercy on him. That will be the signal triumph.<br>
17. If Allah touch thee with affliction, there is none that can relieve<br>
therefrom save Him, and if He touch thee with good fortune [there is none that<br>
can impair it]; for He is Able to do all things.<br>
18. He is the Omnipotent over His slaves, and He is the Wise, the Knower.<br>
19. Say [O Muhammad]: What thing is of most weight in testimony? Say: Allah is<br>
Witness between me and you. And this Qur'an hath been inspired in me, that I may<br>
warn therewith you and whomsoever it may reach. Do ye in sooth bear witness that<br>
there are gods beside Allah? Say: I bear no such witness. Say: He is only One<br>
Allah. Lo! I am innocent of that which ye associate [with Him].<br>
20. Those unto whom We gave the Scripture recognise [this revelation] as they<br>
recognise their sons. Those who ruin their own souls will not believe.<br>
21. Who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah or denieth<br>
His revelations? Lo! the wrongdoers will not be successful.<br>
22. And on the day We gather them together We shall say unto those who ascribed<br>
partners [unto Allah]: Where are [now] those partners of your make-believe?<br>
23. Then will they have no contention save that they will say: By Allah, our<br>
Lord, we never were idolaters.<br>
24. See how they lie against themselves, and [how] the thing which they devised<br>
hath failed them!<br>
25. Of them are some who listen unto thee, but We have placed upon their hearts<br>
veils, lest they should understand, and in their ears a deafness. If they saw<br>
every token they would not believe therein; to the point that, when they come<br>
unto thee to argue with thee, the disbelievers say: This is naught else than<br>
fables of the men of old.<br>
26. And they forbid [men] from it and avoid it, and they ruin none save<br>
themselves, though they perceive not.<br>
27. If thou couldst see when they are set before the Fire and say: Oh, would<br>
that we might return! Then would we not deny the revelations of our Lord but we<br>
would be of the believers!<br>
<br>
56<br>
<br>
28. Nay, but that hath become clear unto them which before they used to hide.<br>
And if they were sent back they would return unto that which they are forbidden.<br>
Lo! they are liars.<br>
29. And they say: There is naught save our life of the world, and we shall not<br>
be raised [again].<br>
30. If thou couldst see when they are set before their Lord! He will say: Is not<br>
this real? They will say: Yea, verily, by our Lord! He will say: Taste now the<br>
retribution for that ye used to disbelieve.<br>
31. They indeed are losers who deny their meeting with Allah until, when the<br>
Hour cometh on them suddenly, they cry: Alas for us, that we neglected it! They<br>
bear upon their backs their burdens. Ah, evil is that which they bear!<br>
32. Naught is the life of the world save a pastime and a spot. Better far is the<br>
abode of the Hereafter for those who keep their duty [to Allah]. Have ye then no<br>
sense?<br>
33. We know well how their talk grieveth thee, though in truth they deny not<br>
thee [Muhammad] but evil-doers flout the revelations of Allah.<br>
34. Messengers indeed have been denied before thee, and they were patient under<br>
the denial and the persecution till Our succour reached them. There is none to<br>
alter the decisions of Allah. Already there hath reached thee [somewhat] of the<br>
tidings of the messengers [We sent before].<br>
35. And if their aversion is grievous unto thee, then, if thou canst, seek a way<br>
down into the earth or a ladder unto the sky that thou mayst bring unto them a<br>
portent [to convince them all]! - If Allah willed, He could have brought them<br>
all together to the guidance - So be not thou among the foolish ones.<br>
36. Only those can accept who hear. As for the dead, Allah will raise them up;<br>
then unto Him they will be returned.<br>
37. They say: Why hath no portent been sent down upon him from his Lord? Say:<br>
Lo! Allah is Able to send down a portent. But most of them know not.<br>
38. There is not an animal in the earth, nor a flying creature flying on two<br>
wings, but they are peoples like unto you. We have neglected nothing in the Book<br>
[of Our decrees]. Then unto their Lord they will be gathered.<br>
39. Those who deny Our revelations are deaf and dumb in darkness. Whom Allah<br>
will sendeth astray, and whom He will He placeth on a straight path.<br>
40. Say: Can ye see yourselves, if the punishment of Allah come upon you or the<br>
Hour come upon you, [calling upon other than Allah]? Do ye then call [for help]<br>
to any other than Allah? [Answer that] if ye are truthful.<br>
41. Nay, but unto Him ye call, and He removeth that because of which ye call<br>
unto Him, if He will, and ye forget whatever partners ye ascribed unto Him.<br>
42. We have sent already unto peoples that were before thee, and We visited them<br>
with tribulation and adversity, in order that they might grow humble.<br>
43. If only, when Our disaster came on them, they had been humble! But their<br>
hearts were hardened and the devil made all that they used to do seem fair unto<br>
them!<br>
44. Then, when they forgot that whereof they had been reminded, We opened unto<br>
them the gates of all things till, even as they were rejoicing in that which<br>
they were given, We seized them unawares, and lo! they were dumbfounded.<br>
45. So of the people who did wrong the last remnant was cut off. Praise be to<br>
Allah, Lord of the Worlds!<br>
57<br>
<br>
46. Say: Have ye imagined, if Allah should take away your hearing and your sight<br>
and seal your hearts, Who is the Allah Who could restore it to you save Allah?<br>
See how We display the revelations unto them! Yet still they turn away.<br>
47. Say: Can ye see yourselves, if the punishment of Allah come upon you<br>
unawares or openly? Would any perish save wrongdoing folk?<br>
48. We send not the messengers save as bearers of good news and warners. Whoso<br>
believeth and doeth right, there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they<br>
grieve.<br>
49. But as for those who deny Our revelations, torment will afflict them for<br>
that they used to disobey.<br>
50. Say [O Muhammad, to the disbelievers]: I say not unto you [that] I possess<br>
the treasures of Allah, nor that I have knowledge of the Unseen; and I say not<br>
unto you: Lo! I am an angel. I follow only that which is inspired in me. Say:<br>
Are the blind man and the seer equal? Will ye not then take thought?<br>
51. Warn hereby those who fear [because they know] that they will be gathered<br>
unto their Lord, for whom there is no protecting ally nor intercessor beside<br>
Him, that they may ward off [evil].<br>
52. Repel not those who call upon their Lord at morn and evening, seeking His<br>
Countenance. Thou art not accountable for them in aught, nor are they<br>
accountable for thee in aught, that thou shouldst repel them and be of the<br>
wrong-doers.<br>
53. And even so do We try some of them by others, that they say: Are these they<br>
whom Allah favoureth among us? Is not Allah best Aware of the thanksgivers?<br>
54. And when those who believe in Our revelations come unto thee, say: Peace be<br>
unto you! Your Lord hath prescribed for Himself mercy, that whoso of you doeth<br>
evil through ignorance and repenteth afterward thereof and doeth right, [for<br>
him] lo! He is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
55. Thus do We expound the revelations that the way of the unrighteous may be<br>
manifest.<br>
56. Say: I am forbidden to worship those on whom ye call instead of Allah. Say:<br>
I will not follow your desires, for then should I go astray and I should not be<br>
of the rightly guided.<br>
57. Say: I am [relying] on clear proof from my Lord, while ye deny Him. I have<br>
not that for which ye are impatient. The decision is for Allah only. He telleth<br>
the truth and He is the Best of Deciders.<br>
58. Say: If I had that for which ye are impatient, then would the case [ere<br>
this] have been decided between me and you. Allah is Best Aware of the wrongdoers.<br>
59. And with Him are the keys of the Invisible. None but He knoweth them. And He<br>
knoweth what is in the land and the sea. Not a leaf falleth but He knoweth it,<br>
not a grain amid the darkness of the earth, naught of wet or dry but [it is<br>
noted] in a clear record.<br>
60. He it is Who gathereth you at night and knoweth that which ye commit by day.<br>
Then He raiseth you again to life therein, that the term appointed [for you] may<br>
be accomplished. And afterward unto Him is your return. Then He will proclaim<br>
unto you what ye used to do.<br>
61. He is the Omnipotent over His slaves. He sendeth guardians over you until,<br>
when death cometh unto one of you, Our messengers receive him, and they neglect<br>
not.<br>
58<br>
<br>
62. Then are they restored unto Allah, their Lord, the Just. Surely His is the<br>
judgment. And He is the most swift of reckoners.<br>
63. Say: Who delivereth you from the darkness of the land and the sea? Ye call<br>
upon Him humbly and in secret, [saying]: If we are delivered from this [fear] we<br>
truly will be of the thankful.<br>
64. Say: Allah delivereth you from this and from all affliction. Yet ye<br>
attribute partners unto Him.<br>
65. Say: He is able to send punishment upon you from above you or from beneath<br>
your feet, or to bewilder you with dissension and make you taste the tyranny one<br>
of another. See how We display the revelations so that they may understand.<br>
66. Thy people [O Muhammad] have denied it, though it is the Truth. Say: I am<br>
not put in charge of you.<br>
67. For every announcement there is a term, and ye will come to know.<br>
68. And when thou seest those who meddle with Our revelations, withdraw from<br>
them until they meddle with another topic. And if the devil cause thee to<br>
forget, sit not, after the remembrance, with the congregation of wrong-doers.<br>
69. Those who ward off [evil] are not accountable for them in aught, but the<br>
Reminder [must be given them] that haply they [too] may ward off [evil].<br>
70. And forsake those who take their religion for a pastime and a jest, and whom<br>
the life of the world beguileth. Remind [mankind] hereby lest a soul be<br>
destroyed by what it earneth. It hath beside Allah no protecting ally nor<br>
intercessor, and though it offer every compensation it will not be accepted from<br>
it. Those are they who perish by their own deserts. For them is drink of boiling<br>
water and a painful doom, because they disbelieved.<br>
71. Say: Shall we cry, instead of unto Allah, unto that which neither profiteth<br>
us nor hurteth us, and shall we turn back after Allah hath guided us, like one<br>
bewildered whom the devils have infatuated in the earth, who hath companions who<br>
invite him to the guidance [saying]: Come unto us? Say: Lo! the guidance of<br>
Allah is Guidance, and we are ordered to surrender to the Lord of the Worlds,<br>
72. And to establish worship and be dutiful to Him, and He it is unto Whom ye<br>
will be gathered.<br>
73. He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth. In the day when He<br>
saith: Be! it is. His Word is the Truth, and His will be the Sovereignty on the<br>
day when the trumpet is blown. Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, He is<br>
the Wise, the Aware.<br>
74. [Remember] when Abraham said unto his father Azar: Takest thou idols for<br>
gods? Lo! I see thee and thy folk in error manifest.<br>
75. Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he<br>
might be of those possessing certainty:<br>
76. When the night grew dark upon him he beheld a star. He said: This is my<br>
Lord. But when it set, he said: I love not things that set.<br>
77. And when he saw the moon uprising, he exclaimed: This is my Lord. But when<br>
it set, he said: Unless my Lord guide me, I surely shall become one of the folk<br>
who are astray.<br>
78. And when he saw the sun uprising, he cried: This is my Lord! This is<br>
greater! And when it set he exclaimed: O my people! Lo! I am free from all that<br>
ye associate [with Him].<br>
<br>
59<br>
<br>
79. Lo! I have turned my face toward Him Who created the heavens and the earth,<br>
as one by nature upright, and I am not of the idolaters.<br>
80. His people argued with him. He said: Dispute ye with me concerning Allah<br>
when He hath guided me? I fear not at all that which ye set up beside Him unless<br>
my Lord willeth aught. My Lord includeth all things in His knowledge. Will ye<br>
not then remember?<br>
81. How should I fear that which ye set up beside Him, when ye fear not to set<br>
up beside Allah that for which He hath revealed unto you no warrant? Which of<br>
the two factions hath more right to safety? [Answer me that] if ye have<br>
knowledge.<br>
82. Those who believe and obscure not their belief by wrongdoing, theirs is<br>
safety; and they are rightly guided.<br>
83. That is Our argument. We gave it unto Abraham against his folk. We raise<br>
unto degrees of wisdom whom We will. Lo! thy Lord is Wise, Aware.<br>
84. And We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob; each of them We guided; and Noah<br>
did We guide aforetime; and of his seed [We guided] David and Solomon and Job<br>
and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward the good.<br>
85. And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias. Each one [of them] was of the<br>
righteous.<br>
86. And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot. Each one [of them] did We prefer<br>
above [Our] creatures,<br>
87. With some of their forefathers and their offspring and their brethren; and<br>
We chose them and guided them unto a straight path.<br>
88. Such is the guidance of Allah wherewith He guideth whom He will of His<br>
bondmen. But if they had set up [for worship] aught beside Him, [all] that they<br>
did would have been vain.<br>
89. Those are they unto whom We gave the Scripture and command and prophethood.<br>
But if these disbelieve therein, then indeed We shall entrust it to a people who<br>
will not be disbelievers therein.<br>
90. Those are they whom Allah guideth, so follow their guidance. Say [O<br>
Muhammad, unto mankind]: I ask of you no fee for it. Lo! it is naught but a<br>
Reminder to [His] creatures.<br>
91. And they measure not the power of Allah its true measure when they say:<br>
Allah hath naught revealed unto a human being. Say [unto the Jews who speak<br>
thus]: Who revealed the Book which Moses brought, a light and guidance for<br>
mankind, which ye have put on parchments which ye show, but ye hide much<br>
[thereof], and [by which] ye were taught that which ye knew not yourselves nor<br>
[did] your fathers [know it]? Say: Allah. Then leave them to their play of<br>
cavilling.<br>
92. And this is a blessed Scripture which We have revealed, confirming that<br>
which [was revealed] before it, that thou mayst warn the Mother of Villages and<br>
those around her. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe herein, and they<br>
are careful of their worship.<br>
93. Who is guilty of more wrong than he who forgeth a lie against Allah, or<br>
saith: I am inspired, when he is not inspired in aught; and who saith: I will<br>
reveal the like of that which Allah hath revealed? If thou couldst see, when the<br>
wrong-doers reach the pangs of death and the angels stretch their hands out<br>
[saying]: Deliver up your souls. This day ye are awarded doom of degradation for<br>
<br>
60<br>
<br>
that ye spake concerning Allah other than the truth, and used to scorn His<br>
portents.<br>
94. Now have ye come unto Us solitary as We did create you at the first, and ye<br>
have left behind you all that We bestowed upon you, and We behold not with you<br>
those your intercessors, of whom ye claimed that they possessed a share in you.<br>
Now is the bond between you severed, and that which ye presumed hath failed you.<br>
95. Lo! Allah [it is] Who splitteth the grain of corn and the date-stone [for<br>
sprouting]. He bringeth forth the living from the dead, and is the bringer-forth<br>
of the dead from the living. Such is Allah. How then are ye perverted?<br>
96. He is the Cleaver of the Daybreak, and He hath appointed the night for<br>
stillness, and the sun and the moon for reckoning. That is the measuring of the<br>
Mighty, the Wise.<br>
97. And He it is Who hath set for you the stars that ye may guide your course by<br>
them amid the darkness of the land and the sea. We have detailed Our revelations<br>
for a people who have knowledge.<br>
98. And He it is Who hath produced you from a single being, and [hath given you]<br>
a habitation and a repository. We have detailed Our revelations for a people who<br>
have understanding.<br>
99. He it is Who sendeth down water from the sky, and therewith We bring forth<br>
buds of every kind; We bring forth the green blade from which We bring forth the<br>
thick-clustered grain; and from the date-palm, from the pollen thereof, spring<br>
pendant bunches; and [We bring forth] gardens of grapes, and the olive and the<br>
pomegranate, alike and unlike. Look upon the fruit thereof, when they bear<br>
fruit, and upon its ripening. Lo! herein verily are portents for a people who<br>
believe.<br>
100. Yet they ascribe as partners unto Him the jinn, although He did create<br>
them, and impute falsely, without knowledge, sons and daughters unto Him.<br>
Glorified be He and High Exalted above [all] that they ascribe [unto Him].<br>
101. The Originator of the heavens and the earth! How can He have a child, when<br>
there is for Him no consort, when He created all things and is Aware of all<br>
things?<br>
102. Such is Allah, your Lord. There is no Allah save Him, the Creator of all<br>
things, so worship Him. And He taketh care of all things.<br>
103. Vision comprehendeth Him not, but He comprehendeth [all] vision. He is the<br>
Subtile, the Aware.<br>
104. Proofs have come unto you from your Lord, so whoso seeth, it is for his own<br>
good, and whoso is blind is blind to his own hurt. And I am not a keeper over<br>
you.<br>
105. Thus do We display Our revelations that they may say [unto thee, Muhammad]:<br>
"Thou hast studied," and that We may make [it] clear for people who have<br>
knowledge.<br>
106. Follow that which is inspired in thee from thy Lord; there is no Allah save<br>
Him; and turn away from the idolaters.<br>
107. Had Allah willed, they had not been idolatrous. We have not set thee as a<br>
keeper over them, nor art thou responsible for them.<br>
108. Revile not those unto whom they pray beside Allah lest they wrongfully<br>
revile Allah through ignorance. Thus unto every nation have We made their deed<br>
seem fair. Then unto their Lord is their return, and He will tell them what they<br>
used to do.<br>
61<br>
<br>
109. And they swear a solemn oath by Allah that if there come unto them a<br>
portent they will believe therein. Say; Portents are with Allah and [so is] that<br>
which telleth you that if such came unto them they would not believe.<br>
110. We confound their hearts and their eyes. As they believed not therein at<br>
the first, We let them wander blindly on in their contumacy.<br>
111. And though We should send down the angels unto them, and the dead should<br>
speak unto them, and We should gather against them all things in array, they<br>
would not believe unless Allah so willed. Howbeit, most of them are ignorant.<br>
112. Thus have We appointed unto every prophet an adversary - devils of<br>
humankind and jinn who inspire in one another plausible discourse through guile.<br>
If thy Lord willed, they would not do so; so leave them alone with their<br>
devising;<br>
113. That the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter may incline<br>
thereto, and that they may take pleasure therein, and that they may earn what<br>
they are earning.<br>
114. Shall I seek other than Allah for judge, when He it is Who hath revealed<br>
unto you [this] Scripture, fully explained? Those unto whom We gave the<br>
Scripture [aforetime] know that it is revealed from thy Lord in truth. So be not<br>
thou [O Muhammad] of the waverers.<br>
115. Perfected is the Word of thy Lord in truth and justice. There is naught<br>
that can change His words. He is the Hearer, the Knower.<br>
116. If thou obeyedst most of those on earth they would mislead thee far from<br>
Allah's way. They follow naught but an opinion, and they do but guess.<br>
117. Lo! thy Lord, He knoweth best who erreth from His way; and He knoweth best<br>
[who are] the rightly guided.<br>
118. Eat of that over which the name of Allah hath been mentioned, if ye are<br>
believers in His revelations.<br>
119. How should ye not eat of that over which the name of Allah hath been<br>
mentioned, when He hath explained unto you that which is forbidden unto you<br>
unless ye are compelled thereto. But lo! many are led astray by their own lusts<br>
through ignorance. Lo! thy Lord, He is Best Aware of the transgressors.<br>
120. Forsake the outwardness of sin and the inwardness thereof. Lo! those who<br>
garner sin will be awarded that which they have earned.<br>
121. And eat not of that whereon Allah's name hath not been mentioned, for lo!<br>
it is abomination. Lo! the devils do inspire their minions to dispute with you.<br>
But if ye obey them, ye will be in truth idolaters.<br>
122. Is he who was dead and We have raised him unto life, and set for him a<br>
light wherein he walketh among men, as him whose similitude is in utter darkness<br>
whence he cannot emerge? Thus is their conduct made fairseeming for the<br>
disbelievers.<br>
123. And thus have We made in every city great ones of its wicked ones, that<br>
they should plot therein. They do but plot against themselves, though they<br>
perceive not.<br>
124. And when a token cometh unto them, they say: We will not believe till we<br>
are given that which Allah's messengers are given. Allah knoweth best with whom<br>
to place His message. Humiliation from Allah and heavy punishment will smite the<br>
guilty for their scheming.<br>
<br>
62<br>
<br>
125. And whomsoever it is Allah's will to guide, He expandeth his bosom unto the<br>
Surrender, and whomsoever it is His Will to send astray, He maketh his bosom<br>
close and narrow as if he were engaged in sheer ascent. Thus Allah layeth<br>
ignominy upon those who believe not.<br>
126. This is the path of thy Lord, a straight path. We have detailed Our<br>
revelations for a people who take heed.<br>
127. For them is the abode of peace with their Lord. He will be their Protecting<br>
Friend because of what they used to do.<br>
128. In the day when He will gather them together [He will say]: O ye assembly<br>
of the jinn! Many of humankind did ye seduce. And their adherents among<br>
humankind will say: Our Lord! We enjoyed one another, but now we have arrived at<br>
the appointed term which Thou appointedst for us. He will say: Fire is your<br>
home. Abide therein for ever, save him whom Allah willeth [to deliver]. Lo! thy<br>
Lord is Wise, Aware.<br>
129. Thus We let some of the wrong-doers have power over others because of what<br>
they are wont to earn.<br>
130. O ye assembly of the jinn and humankind! Came there not unto you messengers<br>
of your own who recounted unto you My tokens and warned you of the meeting of<br>
this your Day? They will say: We testify against ourselves. And the life of the<br>
world beguiled them. And they testify against themselves that they were<br>
disbelievers.<br>
131. This is because thy Lord destroyeth not the townships arbitrarily while<br>
their people are unconscious [of the wrong they do].<br>
132. For all there will be ranks from what they did. Thy Lord is not unaware of<br>
what they do.<br>
133. Thy Lord is the Absolute, the Lord of Mercy. If He will, He can remove you<br>
and can cause what He will to follow after you, even as He raised you from the<br>
seed of other folk.<br>
134. Lo! that which ye are promised will surely come to pass, and ye cannot<br>
escape.<br>
135. Say [O Muhammad]: O my people! Work according to your power. Lo! I too am<br>
working. Thus ye will come to know for which of us will be the happy sequel. Lo!<br>
the wrong-doers will not be successful.<br>
136. They assign unto Allah, of the crops and cattle which He created, a<br>
portion, and they say: "This is Allah's" - in their make-believe - "and this is<br>
for [His] partners in regard to us." Thus that which [they assign] unto His<br>
partners in them reacheth not Allah and that which [they assign] unto Allah<br>
goeth to their [so-called] partners. Evil is their ordinance.<br>
137. Thus have their [so-called] partners [of Allah] made the killing of their<br>
children to seem fair unto many of the idolaters, that they may ruin them and<br>
make their faith obscure for them. Had Allah willed [it otherwise], they had not<br>
done so. So leave them alone with their devices.<br>
138. And they say: Such cattle and crops are forbidden. No-one is to eat of them<br>
save whom we will - in their make-believe - cattle whose backs are forbidden,<br>
cattle over which they mention not the name of Allah. [All that is] a lie<br>
against Him. He will repay them for that which they invent.<br>
139. And they say: That which is in the bellies of such cattle is reserved for<br>
our males and is forbidden to our wives; but if it be born dead, then they [all]<br>
<br>
63<br>
<br>
may be partakers thereof. He will reward them for their attribution [of such<br>
ordinances unto Him]. Lo, He is Wise, Aware.<br>
140. They are losers who besottedly have slain their children without knowledge,<br>
and have forbidden that which Allah bestowed upon them, inventing a lie against<br>
Allah. They indeed have gone astray and are not guided.<br>
141. He it is Who produceth gardens trellised and untrellised, and the datepalm, and crops of divers flavour, and the olive and the pomegranate, like and<br>
unlike. Eat ye of the fruit thereof when it fruiteth, and pay the due thereof<br>
upon the harvest day, and be not prodigal. Lo! Allah loveth not the prodigals.<br>
142. And of the cattle [He produceth] some for burdens, some for food. Eat of<br>
that which Allah hath bestowed upon you, and follow not the footsteps of the<br>
devil, for lo! he is an open foe to you.<br>
143. Eight pairs: Of the sheep twain, and of the goats twain. Say: Hath He<br>
forbidden the two males or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two<br>
females contain? Expound to me [the case] with knowledge, if ye are truthful.<br>
144. And of the camels twain and of the oxen twain. Say: Hath He forbidden the<br>
two males or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two females<br>
contain; or were ye by to witness when Allah commanded you [all] this? Then who<br>
doth greater wrong than he who deviseth a lie concerning Allah, that he may lead<br>
mankind astray without knowledge. Lo! Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.<br>
145. Say: I find not in that which is revealed unto me aught prohibited to an<br>
eater that he eat thereof, except it be carrion, or blood poured forth, or<br>
swineflesh - for that verily is foul - or the abomination which was immolated to<br>
the name of other than Allah. But whoso is compelled [thereto], neither craving<br>
nor transgressing, [for him] lo! thy Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
146. Unto those who are Jews We forbade every animal with claws. And of the oxen<br>
and the sheep forbade We unto them the fat thereof save that upon the backs or<br>
the entrails, or that which is mixed with the bone. That we awarded them for<br>
their rebellion. And lo! we verily are truthful.<br>
147. So if they give the lie to thee [Muhammad], say: Your Lord is a Lord of<br>
All-Embracing Mercy, and His wrath will never be withdrawn from guilty folk.<br>
148. They who are idolaters will say: Had Allah willed, we had not ascribed<br>
[unto Him] partners neither had our fathers, nor had we forbidden aught. Thus<br>
did those who were before them give the lie [to Allah's messengers] till they<br>
tasted of the fear of Us. Say: Have ye any knowledge that ye can adduce for Us?<br>
Lo! ye follow naught but an opinion, Lo! ye do but guess.<br>
149. Say - For Allah's is the final argument - Had He willed He could indeed<br>
have guided all of you.<br>
150. Say: Come, bring your witnesses who can bear witness that Allah forbade<br>
[all] this. And if they bear witness, do not thou bear witness with them. Follow<br>
thou not the whims of those who deny Our revelations, those who believe not in<br>
the Hereafter and deem [others] equal with their Lord.<br>
151. Say: Come, I will recite unto you that which your Lord hath made a sacred<br>
duty for you: That ye ascribe no thing as partner unto Him and that ye do good<br>
to parents, and that ye slay not your children because of penury - We provide<br>
for you and for them - and that ye draw not nigh to lewd things whether open or<br>
concealed. And that ye slay not the life which Allah hath made sacred, save in<br>
the course of justice. This He hath command you, in order that ye may discern.<br>
152. And approach not the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better,<br>
till he reach maturity. Give full measure and full weight, in justice. We task<br>
<br>
64<br>
<br>
not any soul beyond its scope. And if ye give your word, do justice thereunto,<br>
even though it be [against] a kinsman; and fulfil the covenant of Allah. This He<br>
commandeth you that haply ye may remember.<br>
153. And [He commandeth you, saying]: This is My straight path, so follow it.<br>
Follow not other ways, lest ye be parted from His way. This hath He ordained for<br>
you, that ye may ward off [evil].<br>
154. Again, We gave the Scripture unto Moses, complete for him who would do<br>
good, an explanation of all things, a guidance and a mercy, that they might<br>
believe in the meeting with their Lord.<br>
155. And this is a blessed Scripture which We have revealed. So follow it and<br>
ward off [evil], that ye may find mercy.<br>
156. Lest ye should say: The Scripture was revealed only to two sects before us,<br>
and we in sooth were unaware of what they read;<br>
157. Or lest ye should say: If the Scripture had been revealed unto us, we<br>
surely had been better guided than are they. Now hath there come unto you a<br>
clear proof from your Lord, a guidance and mercy; and who doeth greater wrong<br>
than he who denieth the revelations of Allah, and turneth away from them? We<br>
award unto those who turn away from Our revelations an evil doom because of<br>
their aversion.<br>
158. Wait they, indeed, for nothing less than that the angels should come unto<br>
them, or thy Lord should come, or there should come one of the portents from thy<br>
Lord? In the day when one of the portents from thy Lord cometh, its belief<br>
availeth naught a soul which theretofore believed not, nor in its belief earned<br>
good [by works]. Say: Wait ye! Lo! We [too] are waiting.<br>
159. Lo! As for those who sunder their religion and become schismatics, no<br>
concern at all hast thou with them. Their case will go to Allah, Who then will<br>
tell them what they used to do.<br>
160. Whoso bringeth a good deed will receive tenfold the like thereof, while<br>
whoso bringeth an ill-deed will be awarded but the like thereof; and they will<br>
not be wronged.<br>
161. Say: Lo! As for me, my Lord hath guided me unto a straight path, a right<br>
religion, the community of Abraham, the upright, who was no idolater.<br>
162. Say: Lo! my worship and my sacrifice and my living and my dying are for<br>
Allah, Lord of the Worlds.<br>
163. He hath no partner. This am I commanded, and I am first of those who<br>
surrender [unto Him].<br>
164. Say: Shall I seek another than Allah for Lord, when He is Lord of all<br>
things? Each soul earneth only on its own account, nor doth any laden bear<br>
another's load. Then unto your Lord is your return and He will tell you that<br>
wherein ye differed.<br>
165. He it is Who hath placed you as viceroys of the earth and hath exalted some<br>
of you in rank above others, that He may try you by [the test of] that which He<br>
hath given you. Lo! Thy Lord is swift in prosecution, and Lo! He verily is<br>
Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
<br>
SURA 7. AL-ARAF (THE HEIGHTS)<br>
1. Alif. Lam. Mim. Sad.<br>
<br>
65<br>
<br>
2. [It is] a Scripture that is revealed unto thee [Muhammad] - so let there be<br>
no heaviness in thy heart therefrom - that thou mayst warn thereby, and [it is]<br>
a Reminder unto believers.<br>
3. [Saying]: Follow that which is sent down unto you from your Lord, and follow<br>
no protecting friends beside Him. Little do ye recollect!<br>
4. How many a township have We destroyed! As a raid by night, or while they<br>
slept at noon, Our terror came unto them.<br>
5. No plea had they, when Our terror came unto them, save that they said: Lo! We<br>
were wrong-doers.<br>
6. Then verily We shall question those unto whom [Our message] hath been sent,<br>
and verily We shall question the messengers.<br>
7. Then verily We shall narrate unto them [the event] with knowledge, for We<br>
were not absent [when it came to pass].<br>
8. The weighing on that day is the true [weighing]. As for those whose scale is<br>
heavy, they are the successful.<br>
9. And as for those whose scale is light: those are they who lose their souls<br>
because they used to wrong Our revelations.<br>
10. And We have given you [mankind] power in the earth, and appointed for you<br>
therein livelihoods. Little give ye thanks!<br>
11. And We created you, then fashioned you, then told the angels: Fall ye<br>
prostrate before Adam! And they fell prostrate, all save Iblis, who was not of<br>
those who make prostration.<br>
12. He said: What hindered thee that thou didst not fall prostrate when I bade<br>
thee? [Iblis] said: I am better than him. Thou createdst me of fire while him<br>
Thou didst create of mud.<br>
13. He said: Then go down hence! It is not for thee to show pride here, so go<br>
forth! Lo! thou art of those degraded.<br>
14. He said: Reprieve me till the day when they are raised [from the dead].<br>
15. He said: Lo! thou art of those reprieved.<br>
16. He said: Now, because Thou hast sent me astray, verily I shall lurk in<br>
ambush for them on Thy Right Path.<br>
17. Then I shall come upon them from before them and from behind them and from<br>
their right hands and from their left hands, and Thou wilt not find most of them<br>
beholden [unto Thee].<br>
18. He said: Go forth from hence, degraded, banished. As for such of them as<br>
follow thee, surely I will fill hell with all of you.<br>
19. And [unto man]: O Adam! Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden and eat from<br>
whence ye will, but come not nigh this tree lest ye become wrong-doers.<br>
20. Then Satan whispered to them that he might manifest unto them that which was<br>
hidden from them of their shame, and he said: Your Lord forbade you from this<br>
tree only lest ye should become angels or become of the immortals.<br>
21. And he swore unto them [saying]: Lo! I am a sincere adviser unto you.<br>
22. Thus did he lead them on with guile. And when they tasted of the tree their<br>
shame was manifest to them and they began to hide [by heaping] on themselves<br>
some of the leaves of the Garden. And their Lord called them, [saying]: Did I<br>
not forbid you from that tree and tell you: Lo! Satan is an open enemy to you?<br>
<br>
66<br>
<br>
23. They said: Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If thou forgive us not and<br>
have not mercy on us, surely we are of the lost!<br>
24. He said: Go down [from hence], one of you a foe unto the other. There will<br>
be for you on earth a habitation and provision for a while.<br>
25. He said: There shall ye live, and there shall ye die, and thence shall ye be<br>
brought forth.<br>
26. O Children of Adam! We have revealed unto you raiment to conceal your shame,<br>
and splendid vesture, but the raiment of restraint from evil, that is best. This<br>
is of the revelations of Allah, that they may remember.<br>
27. O Children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you as he caused your [first]<br>
parents to go forth from the Garden and tore off from them their robe [of<br>
innocence] that he might manifest their shame to them. Lo! he seeth you, he and<br>
his tribe, from whence ye see him not. Lo! We have made the devils protecting<br>
friends for those who believe not.<br>
28. And when they do some lewdness they say: We found our fathers doing it and<br>
Allah hath enjoined it on us. Say: Allah, verily, enjoineth not lewdness. Tell<br>
ye concerning Allah that which ye know not?<br>
29. Say: My Lord enjoineth justice. And set your faces upright [toward Him] at<br>
every place of worship and call upon Him, making religion pure for Him [only].<br>
As He brought you into being, so return ye [unto Him].<br>
30. A party hath He led aright, while error hath just hold over [another] party,<br>
for lo! they choose the devils for protecting supporters instead of Allah and<br>
deem that they are rightly guided.<br>
31. O Children of Adam! Look to your adornment at every place of worship, and<br>
eat and drink, but be not prodigal. Lo! He loveth not the prodigals.<br>
32. Say: Who hath forbidden the adornment of Allah which He hath brought forth<br>
for His bondmen, and the good things of His providing? Say: Such, on the Day of<br>
Resurrection, will be only for those who believed during the life of the world.<br>
Thus do we detail Our revelations for people who have knowledge.<br>
33. Say: My Lord forbiddeth only indecencies, such of them as are apparent and<br>
such as are within, and sin and wrongful oppression, and that ye associate with<br>
Allah that for which no warrant hath been revealed, and that ye tell concerning<br>
Allah that which ye know not.<br>
34. And every nation hath its term, and when its term cometh, they cannot put it<br>
off an hour nor yet advance [it].<br>
35. O Children of Adam! When messengers of your own come unto you who narrate<br>
unto you My revelations, then whosoever refraineth from evil and amendeth there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.<br>
36. But they who deny Our revelations and scorn them - each are rightful owners<br>
of the Fire; they will abide therein.<br>
37. Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah or<br>
denieth Our tokens. [For such] their appointed portion of the Book [of destiny]<br>
reacheth them till, when Our messengers come to gather them, they say: Where<br>
[now] is that to which ye cried beside Allah? They say: They have departed from<br>
us. And they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.<br>
38. He saith: Enter into the Fire among nations of the jinn and humankind who<br>
passed away before you. Every time a nation entereth, it curseth its sister<br>
[nation] till, when they have all been made to follow one another thither, the<br>
last of them saith unto the first of them: Our Lord! These led us astray, so<br>
67<br>
<br>
give them double torment of the Fire. He saith: For each one there is double<br>
[torment], but ye know not.<br>
39. And the first of them saith unto the last of them: Ye were no whit better<br>
than us, so taste the doom for what ye used to earn.<br>
40. Lo! they who deny Our revelations and scorn them, for them the gates of<br>
heaven will nor be opened not will they enter the Garden until the camel goeth<br>
through the needle's eye. Thus do We requite the guilty.<br>
41. Theirs will be a bed of hell, and over them coverings [of hell]. Thus do We<br>
requite wrong-doers.<br>
42. But [as for] those who believe and do good works - We tax not any soul<br>
beyond its scope - Such are rightful owners of the Garden. They abide therein.<br>
43. And We remove whatever rancour may be in their hearts. Rivers flow beneath<br>
them. And they say: The praise to Allah, Who hath guided us to this. We could<br>
not truly have been led aright if Allah had not guided us. Verily the messengers<br>
of our Lord did bring the Truth. And it is cried unto them: This is the Garden.<br>
Ye inherit it for what ye used to do.<br>
44. And the dwellers<br>
found that which our<br>
that which your Lord<br>
between them crieth:<br>
<br>
of the Garden cry unto the dwellers of the Fire: We have<br>
Lord promised us [to be] the Truth. Have ye [too] found<br>
promised the Truth? They say: Yea, verily. And a crier in<br>
The curse of Allah is on evil-doers,<br>
<br>
45. Who debar [men] from the path of Allah and would have it crooked, and who<br>
are disbelievers in the Last Day.<br>
46. Between them is a veil. And on the Heights are men who know them all by<br>
their marks. And they call unto the dwellers of the Garden: Peace be unto you!<br>
They enter it not although they hope [to enter].<br>
47. And when their eyes are turned toward the dwellers of the Fire, they say:<br>
Our Lord! Place us not with the wrong-doing folk.<br>
48. And the dwellers on the Heights call unto men whom they know by their marks,<br>
[saying]: What did your multitude and that in which ye took your pride avail<br>
you?<br>
49. Are these they of whom ye swore that Allah would not show them mercy? [Unto<br>
them it hath been said]: Enter the Garden. No fear shall come upon you nor is it<br>
ye who will grieve.<br>
50. And the dwellers of the Fire cry out unto the dwellers of the Garden: Pour<br>
on us some water or some wherewith Allah hath provided you. They say: Lo! Allah<br>
hath forbidden both to disbelievers [in His guidance],<br>
51. Who took their religion for a sport and pastime, and whom the life of the<br>
world beguiled. So this day We have forgotten them even as they forgot the<br>
meeting of this their Day and as they used to deny Our tokens.<br>
52. Verily We have brought them a Scripture which We expounded with knowledge, a<br>
guidance and a mercy for a people who believe.<br>
53. Await they aught save the fulfilment thereof? On the day when the fulfilment<br>
thereof cometh, those who were before forgetful thereof will say: The messengers<br>
of our Lord did bring the Truth! Have we any intercessors, that they may<br>
intercede for us? Or can we be returned [to life on earth], that we may act<br>
otherwise than we used to act? They have lost their souls, and that which they<br>
devised hath failed them.<br>
<br>
68<br>
<br>
54. Lo! your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days,<br>
then mounted He the Throne. He covereth the night with the day, which is in<br>
haste to follow it, and hath made the sun and the moon and the stars subservient<br>
by His command. His verily is all creation and commandment. Blessed be Allah,<br>
the Lord of the Worlds!<br>
55. [O mankind!] Call upon your Lord humbly and in secret. Lo! He loveth not<br>
aggressors.<br>
56. Work not confusion in the earth after the fair ordering [thereof]. and call<br>
on Him in fear and hope. Lo! the mercy of Allah is nigh unto the good.<br>
57. And He it is Who sendeth the winds as tidings heralding His mercy, till,<br>
when they bear a cloud heavy [with rain], We lead it to a dead land, and then<br>
cause water to descend thereon and thereby bring forth fruits of every kind.<br>
Thus bring We forth the dead. Haply ye may remember.<br>
58. As for the good land, its vegetation cometh forth by permission of its Lord;<br>
while as for that which is bad, only the useless cometh forth [from it]. Thus do<br>
We recount the tokens for people who give thanks.<br>
59. We sent Noah [of old] unto his people, and he said: O my people! Serve<br>
Allah. Ye have no other Allah save Him. Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an<br>
Awful Day.<br>
60. The chieftains of his people said: Lo! we see thee surely in plain error.<br>
61. He said: O my people! There is no error in me, but I am a messenger from the<br>
Lord of the Worlds.<br>
62. I convey unto you the messages of my Lord and give good counsel unto you,<br>
and know from Allah that which ye know not.<br>
63. Marvel ye that there should come unto you a Reminder from your Lord by means<br>
of a man among you, that he may warn you, and that ye may keep from evil, and<br>
that haply ye may find mercy.<br>
64. But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship, and We<br>
drowned those who denied Our tokens. Lo! they were blind folk.<br>
65. And unto [the tribe of] A'ad [We sent] their brother, Hud. He said: O my<br>
people! Serve Allah. Ye have no other Allah save Him. Will ye not ward off<br>
[evil]?<br>
66. The chieftains of his people, who were disbelieving, said: Lo! we surely see<br>
thee in foolishness, and lo! we deem thee of the liars.<br>
67. He said: O my people! There is no foolishness in me, but I am a messenger<br>
from the Lord of the Worlds.<br>
68. I convey unto you the messages of my Lord and am for you a true adviser.<br>
69. Marvel ye that there should<br>
of a man among you, that he may<br>
after Noah's folk, and gave you<br>
of your Lord, that haply ye may<br>
<br>
come unto you a Reminder from your Lord by means<br>
warn you? Remember how He made you viceroys<br>
growth of stature. Remember [all] the bounties<br>
be successful.<br>
<br>
70. They said: Hast come unto us that we should serve Allah alone, and forsake<br>
what our fathers worshipped? Then bring upon us that wherewith thou threatenest<br>
us if thou art of the truthful!<br>
71. He said: Terror and wrath from your Lord have already fallen on you. Would<br>
ye wrangle with me over names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for<br>
which no warrant from Allah hath been revealed? Then await [the consequence],<br>
lo! I [also] am of those awaiting [it].<br>
69<br>
<br>
72. And We saved him and those with him by a mercy from Us, and We cut the root<br>
of those who denied Our revelations and were not believers.<br>
73. And to [the tribe of] Thamud [We sent] their brother Salih. He said: O my<br>
people! Serve Allah. Ye have no other Allah save Him. A wonder from your Lord<br>
hath come unto you. Lo! this is the camel of Allah, a token unto you; so let her<br>
feed in Allah's earth, and touch her not with hurt lest painful torment seize<br>
you.<br>
74. And remember how He made you viceroys after A'ad and gave you station in the<br>
earth. Ye choose castles in the plains and hew the mountains into dwellings. So<br>
remember [all] the bounties of Allah and do not evil, making mischief in the<br>
earth.<br>
75. The chieftains of his people, who were scornful, said unto those whom they<br>
despised, unto such of them as believed: Know ye that Salih is one sent from his<br>
Lord? They said: Lo! In that wherewith he hath been sent we are believers.<br>
76. Those who were scornful said: Lo! in that which ye believe we are<br>
disbelievers.<br>
77. So they hamstrung the she-camel, and they flouted the commandment of their<br>
Lord, and they said: O Salih! Bring upon us that thou threatenest if thou art<br>
indeed of those sent [from Allah].<br>
78. So the earthquake seized them, and morning found them prostrate in their<br>
dwelling-place.<br>
79. And [Salih] turned from them and said: O my people! I delivered my Lord's<br>
message unto you and gave you good advice, but ye love not good advisers.<br>
80. And Lot! [Remember] when he said unto his folk: Will ye commit abomination<br>
such as no creature ever did before you?<br>
81. Lo! ye come with lust unto men instead of women. Nay, but ye are wanton<br>
folk.<br>
82. And the answer of his people was only that they said [one to another]: Turn<br>
them out of your township. They are folk, forsooth, who keep pure.<br>
83. And We rescued him and his household, save his wife, who was of those who<br>
stayed behind.<br>
84. And We rained a rain upon them. See now the nature of the consequence of<br>
evil-doers!<br>
85. And unto Midian [We sent] their brother, Shu'eyb. He said: O my people!<br>
Serve Allah. Ye have no other Allah save Him. Lo! a clear proof hath come unto<br>
you from your Lord; so give full measure and full weight and wrong not mankind<br>
in their goods, and work not confusion in the earth after the fair ordering<br>
thereof. That will be better for you, if ye are believers.<br>
86. Lurk not on every road to threaten [wayfarers], and to turn away from<br>
Allah's path him who believeth in Him, and to seek to make it crooked. And<br>
remember, when ye were but few, how He did multiply you. And see the nature of<br>
the consequence for the corrupters!<br>
87. And if there is a party of you which believeth in that wherewith I have been<br>
sent, and there is a party which believeth not, then have patience until Allah<br>
judge between us. He is the Best of all who deal in judgment.<br>
88. The chieftains of his people, who were scornful, said: Surely we will drive<br>
thee out, O Shu'eyb, and those who believe with thee, from our township, unless<br>
ye return to our religion. He said: Even though we hate it?<br>
<br>
70<br>
<br>
89. We should have invented a lie against Allah if we returned to your religion<br>
after Allah hath rescued us from it. It is not for us to return to it unless<br>
Allah our Lord should [so] will. Our Lord comprehendeth all things in knowledge.<br>
In Allah do we put our trust. Our Lord! Decide with truth between us and our<br>
folk, for Thou art the best of those who make decision.<br>
90. But the chieftains of his people, who were disbelieving, said: If ye follow<br>
Shu'eyb, then truly ye shall be the losers.<br>
91. So the earthquake seized them and morning found them prostrate in their<br>
dwelling-place.<br>
92. Those who denied Shu'eyb became as though they had not dwelt there. Those<br>
who denied Shu'eyb, they were the losers.<br>
93. So he turned from them and said: O my people! I delivered my Lord's messages<br>
unto you and gave you good advice; then how can I sorrow for a people that<br>
rejected [truth]?<br>
94. And We sent no prophet unto any township but We did afflict its folk with<br>
tribulation and adversity that haply they might grow humble.<br>
95. Then changed We the evil plight for good till they grew affluent and said:<br>
Tribulation and distress did touch our fathers. Then We seized them unawares,<br>
when they perceived not.<br>
96. And if the people of the townships had believed and kept from evil, surely<br>
We should have opened for them blessings from the sky and from the earth. But<br>
[unto every messenger] they gave the lie, and so We seized them on account of<br>
what they used to earn.<br>
97. Are the people of the townships then secure from the coming of Our wrath<br>
upon them as a night-raid while they sleep?<br>
98. Or are the people of the townships then secure from the coming of Our wrath<br>
upon them in the daytime while they play?<br>
99. Are they then secure from Allah's scheme? None deemeth himself secure from<br>
Allah's scheme save folk that perish.<br>
100. Is it not an indication to those who inherit the land after its people [who<br>
thus reaped the consequence of evil-doing] that, if We will, We can smite them<br>
for their sins and print upon their hearts so that they hear not?<br>
101. Such were the townships. We relate some tidings of them unto thee<br>
[Muhammad]. Their messengers verily came unto them with clear proofs [of Allah's<br>
Sovereignty], but they could not believe because they had before denied. Thus<br>
doth Allah print upon the hearts of disbelievers [that they hear not].<br>
102. We found no [loyalty to any] covenant in most of them. Nay, most of them We<br>
found wrong-doers.<br>
103. Then, after them, We sent Moses with our tokens unto Pharaoh and his<br>
chiefs, but they repelled them. Now, see the nature of the consequence for the<br>
corrupters!<br>
104. Moses said: O Pharaoh! Lo! I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds,<br>
105. Approved upon condition that I speak concerning Allah nothing but the<br>
truth. I come unto you [lords of Egypt] with a clear proof from your Lord. So<br>
let the Children of Israel go with me.<br>
106. [Pharaoh] said: If thou comest with a token, then produce it, if thou art<br>
of those who speak the truth.<br>
<br>
71<br>
<br>
107. Then he flung down his staff and lo! it was a serpent manifest;<br>
108. And he drew forth his hand [from his bosom], and lo! it was white for the<br>
beholders.<br>
109. The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: Lo! this is some knowing wizard,<br>
110. Who would expel you from your land. Now what do ye advise?<br>
111. They said [unto Pharaoh]: Put him off [a while] - him and his brother - and<br>
send into the cities summoners,<br>
112. To bring each knowing wizard unto thee.<br>
113. And the wizards came to Pharaoh, saying: Surely there will be a reward for<br>
us if we are victors.<br>
114. He answered: Yes, and surely ye shall be of those brought near [to me].<br>
115. They said: O Moses! Either throw [first] or let us be the first throwers?<br>
116. He said: Throw! And when they threw they cast a spell upon the people's<br>
eyes, and overawed them, and produced a mighty spell.<br>
117. And We inspired Moses [saying]: Throw thy staff! And lo! it swallowed up<br>
their lying show.<br>
118. Thus was the Truth vindicated and that which they were doing was made vain.<br>
119. Thus were they there defeated and brought low.<br>
120. And the wizards fell down prostrate,<br>
121. Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,<br>
122. The Lord of Moses and Aaron.<br>
123. Pharaoh said: Ye believe in Him before I give you leave! Lo! this is the<br>
plot that ye have plotted in the city that ye may drive its people hence. But ye<br>
shall come to know!<br>
124. Surely I shall have your hands and feet cut off upon alternate sides. Then<br>
I shall crucify you every one.<br>
125. They said: Lo! We are about to return unto our Lord!<br>
126. Thou takest vengeance on us only forasmuch as we believed the tokens of our<br>
Lord when they came unto us. Our Lord! Vouchsafe unto us steadfastness and make<br>
us die as men who have surrendered [unto Thee].<br>
127. The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: [O King], wilt thou suffer Moses and<br>
his people to make mischief in the land, and flout thee and thy gods? He said:<br>
We will slay their sons and spare their women, for lo! we are in power over<br>
them.<br>
128. And Moses said unto his people: Seek help in Allah and endure. Lo! the<br>
earth is Allah's. He giveth it for an inheritance to whom He will. And lo! the<br>
sequel is for those who keep their duty [unto Him].<br>
129. They said: We suffered hurt before thou camest unto us, and since thou hast<br>
come unto us. He said: It may be that your Lord is going to destroy your<br>
adversary and make you viceroys in the earth, that He may see how ye behave.<br>
130. And we straitened Pharaoh's folk with famine and dearth of fruits, that<br>
peradventure they might heed.<br>
<br>
72<br>
<br>
131. But whenever good befell them, they said: This is ours; and whenever evil<br>
smote them they ascribed it to the evil auspices of Moses and those with him.<br>
Surely their evil auspice was only with Allah. But most of them knew not.<br>
132. And they said: Whatever portent thou bringest wherewith to bewitch us, we<br>
shall not put faith in thee.<br>
133. So We sent against them the flood and the locusts and the vermin and the<br>
frogs and the blood - a succession of clear signs. But they were arrogant and<br>
became a guilty folk.<br>
134. And when the terror fell on them they cried: O Moses! Pray for us unto thy<br>
Lord, because He hath a covenant with thee. If thou removest the terror from us<br>
we verily will trust thee and will let the Children of Israel go with thee.<br>
135. But when We did remove from them the terror for a term which they must<br>
reach, behold! they broke their covenant.<br>
136. Therefore We took retribution from them; therefore We drowned them in the<br>
sea: because they denied Our revelations and were heedless of them.<br>
137. And We caused the folk who were despised to inherit the eastern parts of<br>
the land and the western parts thereof which We had blessed. And the fair word<br>
of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of their endurance;<br>
and We annihilated [all] that Pharaoh and his folk had done and that they had<br>
contrived.<br>
138. And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and they came unto a<br>
people who were given up to idols which they had. They said: O Moses! Make for<br>
us a god even as they have gods. He said: Lo! ye are a folk who know not.<br>
139. Lo! as for these, their way will be destroyed and all that they are doing<br>
is in vain.<br>
140. He said: Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah when He hath favoured<br>
you above [all] creatures?<br>
141. And [remember] when We did deliver you from Pharaoh's folk who were<br>
afflicting you with dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing your<br>
women. That was a tremendous trial from your Lord.<br>
142. And when We did appoint for Moses thirty nights [of solitude], and added to<br>
them ten, and he completed the whole time appointed by his Lord of forty nights;<br>
and Moses said unto his brother, Aaron: Take my place among the people. Do<br>
right, and follow not the way of mischief-makers.<br>
143. And when Moses came to Our appointed tryst and his Lord had spoken unto<br>
him, he said: My Lord! Show me [Thy Self], that I may gaze upon Thee. He said:<br>
Thou wilt not see Me, but gaze upon the mountain! If it stand still in its<br>
place, then thou wilt see Me. And when his Lord revealed [His] glory to the<br>
mountain He sent it crashing down. And Moses fell down senseless. And when he<br>
woke he said: Glory unto Thee! I turn unto Thee repentant, and I am the first of<br>
[true] believers.<br>
144. He said: O Moses! I have preferred thee above mankind by My messages and by<br>
My speaking [unto thee]. So hold that which I have given thee, and be among the<br>
thankful.<br>
145. And We wrote for him, upon the tablets, the lesson to be drawn from all<br>
things and the explanation of all things, then [bade him]: Hold it fast; and<br>
command thy people [saying]: Take the better [course made clear] therein. I<br>
shall show thee the abode of evil-livers.<br>
<br>
73<br>
<br>
146. I shall turn away from My revelations those who magnify themselves<br>
wrongfully in the earth, and if they see each token believe it not, and if they<br>
see the way of righteousness choose it nor for [their] way, and if they see the<br>
way of error choose if for [their] way. That is because they deny Our<br>
revelations and are used to disregard them.<br>
147. Those who deny Our revelations and the meeting of the Hereafter, their<br>
works are fruitless. Are they requited aught save what they used to do?<br>
148. And the folk of Moses, after [he left them], chose a calf [for worship],<br>
[made] out of their ornaments, of saffron hue, which gave a lowing sound. Saw<br>
they not that it spake not unto them nor guided them to any way? They chose it,<br>
and became wrong-doers.<br>
149. And when they feared the consequences thereof and saw that they had gone<br>
astray, they said: Unless our Lord have mercy on us and forgive us, we verily<br>
are of the lost.<br>
150. And when Moses returned unto his people, angry and grieved, he said: Evil<br>
is that [course] which ye took after I had left you. Would ye hasten on the<br>
judgment of your Lord? And he cast down the tablets, and he seized his brother<br>
by the head, dragging him toward him. He said: Son of my mother! Lo! the folk<br>
did judge me weak and almost killed me. Oh, make not mine enemies to triumph<br>
over me and place me not among the evil-doers.<br>
151. He said: My Lord! Have mercy on me and on my brother; bring us into Thy<br>
mercy, Thou the Most Merciful of all who show mercy.<br>
152. Lo! Those who chose the calf [for worship], terror from their Lord and<br>
humiliation will come upon them in the life of the world. Thus do We requite<br>
those who invent a lie.<br>
153. But those who do ill-deeds and afterward repent and believe - lo! for them,<br>
afterward, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
154. Then, when the anger of Moses abated, he took up the tablets, and in their<br>
inscription there was guidance and mercy for all those who fear their Lord.<br>
155. And Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointed tryst and, when<br>
the trembling came on them, he said: My Lord! If Thou hadst willed Thou hadst<br>
destroyed them long before, and me with them. Wilt thou destroy us for that<br>
which the ignorant among us did? It is but Thy trial [of us]. Thou sendest whom<br>
Thou wilt astray and guidest whom Thou wilt: Thou art our Protecting Friend,<br>
therefore forgive us and have mercy on us, Thou, the Best of all who show<br>
forgiveness.<br>
156. And ordain for us in this world that which is good, and in the Hereafter<br>
[that which is good], Lo! We have turned unto Thee. He said: I smite with My<br>
punishment whom I will, and My mercy embraceth all things, therefore I shall<br>
ordain it for those who ward off [evil] and pay the poor-due, and those who<br>
believe Our revelations;<br>
157. Those who follow the messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write,<br>
whom they will find described in the Torah and the Gospel [which are] with them.<br>
He will enjoin on them that which is right and forbid them that which is wrong.<br>
He will make lawful for them all good things and prohibit for them only the<br>
foul; and he will relieve them of their burden and the fetters that they used to<br>
wear. Then those who believe in him, and honour him, and help him, and follow<br>
the light which is sent down with him: they are the successful.<br>
158. Say [O Muhammad]: O mankind! Lo! I am the messenger of Allah to you all [the messenger of] Him unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and<br>
<br>
74<br>
<br>
the earth. There is no Allah save Him. He quickeneth and He giveth death. So<br>
believe in Allah and His messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write,<br>
who believeth in Allah and in His Words, and follow him that haply ye may be led<br>
aright.<br>
159. And of Moses' folk there is a community who lead with truth and establish<br>
justice therewith.<br>
160. We divided them into twelve tribes, nations; and We inspired Moses, when<br>
his people asked him for water, saying: Smite with thy staff the rock! And there<br>
gushed forth therefrom twelve springs, so that each tribe knew their drinkingplace. And we caused the white cloud to overshadow them and sent down for them<br>
the manna and the quails [saying]: Eat of the good things wherewith we have<br>
provided you. They wronged Us not, but they were wont to wrong themselves.<br>
161. And when it was said unto them: Dwell in this township and eat therefrom<br>
whence ye will, and say "Repentance," and enter the gate prostrate; We shall<br>
forgive you your sins; We shall increase [reward] for the right-doers.<br>
162. But those of them who did wrong changed the word which had been told them<br>
for another saying, and We sent down upon them wrath from heaven for their<br>
wrongdoing.<br>
163. Ask them [O Muhammad] of the township that was by the sea, how they did<br>
break the Sabbath, how their big fish came unto them visibly upon their Sabbath<br>
day and on a day when they did not keep Sabbath came they not unto them. Thus<br>
did We try them for that they were evil-livers.<br>
164. And when a community among them said: Why preach ye to a folk whom Allah is<br>
about to destroy or punish with an awful doom, they said: In order to be free<br>
from guilt before your Lord, and that haply they may ward off [evil].<br>
165. And when they forgot that whereof they had been reminded, We rescued those<br>
who forbade wrong, and visited those who did wrong with dreadful punishment<br>
because they were evil-livers.<br>
166. So when they took pride in that which they had been forbidden, We said unto<br>
them: Be ye apes despised and loathed!<br>
167. And [remember] when thy Lord proclaimed that He would raise against them<br>
till the Day of Resurrection those who would lay on them a cruel torment. Lo!<br>
verily thy Lord is swift in prosecution and lo! verily He is Forgiving,<br>
Merciful.<br>
168. And We have sundered them in the earth as [separate] nations. Some of them<br>
are righteous, and some far from that. And We have tried them with good things<br>
and evil things that haply they might return.<br>
169. And a generation hath succeeded them who inherited the scriptures. They<br>
grasp the goods of this low life [as the price of evil-doing] and say: It will<br>
be forgiven us. And if there came to them [again] the offer of the like, they<br>
would accept it [and would sin again]. Hath not the covenant of the Scripture<br>
been taken on their behalf that they should not speak aught concerning Allah<br>
save the truth? And they have studied that which is therein. And the abode of<br>
the Hereafter is better, for those who ward off [evil]. Have ye then no sense?<br>
170. And as for those who make [men] keep the Scripture, and establish worship lo! We squander not the wages of reformers.<br>
171. And when We shook the Mount above them as it were a covering, and they<br>
supposed that it was going to fall upon them [and We said]: Hold fast that which<br>
We have given you, and remember that which is therein, that ye may ward off<br>
[evil].<br>
<br>
75<br>
<br>
172. And [remember] when thy Lord brought forth from the Children of Adam, from<br>
their reins, their seed, and made them testify of themselves, [saying]: Am I not<br>
your Lord? They said: Yea, verily. We testify. [That was] lest ye should say at<br>
the Day of Resurrection: Lo! of this we were unaware;<br>
173. Or lest ye should say: [It is] only [that] our fathers ascribed partners to<br>
Allah of old and we were [their] seed after them. Wilt Thou destroy us on<br>
account of that which those who follow falsehood did?<br>
174. Thus we detail the revelations, that haply they may return.<br>
175. Recite unto them the tale of him to whom We gave Our revelations, but he<br>
sloughed them off, so Satan overtook him and he became of those who lead astray.<br>
176. And had We willed We could have raised him by their means, but he clung to<br>
the earth and followed his own lust. Therefor his likeness is as the likeness of<br>
a dog: if thou attackest him he panteth with his tongue out, and if thou leavest<br>
him he panteth with his tongue out. Such is the likeness of the people who deny<br>
Our revelations. Narrate unto them the history [of the men of old], that haply<br>
they may take thought.<br>
177. Evil as an example are the folk who denied Our revelations, and were wont<br>
to wrong themselves.<br>
178. He whom Allah leadeth, he indeed is led aright, while he whom Allah sendeth<br>
astray - they indeed are losers.<br>
179. Already have We urged unto hell many of the jinn and humankind, having<br>
hearts wherewith they understand not, and having eyes wherewith they see not,<br>
and having ears wherewith they hear not. These are as the cattle - nay, but they<br>
are worse! These are the neglectful.<br>
180. Allah's are the fairest names. Invoke Him by them. And leave the company of<br>
those who blaspheme His names. They will be requited what they do.<br>
181. And of those whom We created there is a nation who guide with the Truth and<br>
establish justice therewith.<br>
182. And those who deny Our revelations - step by step We lead them on from<br>
whence they know not.<br>
183. I give them rein [for] lo! My scheme is strong.<br>
184. Have they not bethought them [that] there is no madness in their comrade?<br>
He is but a plain warner.<br>
185. Have they not considered the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and<br>
what things Allah hath created, and that it may be that their own term draweth<br>
nigh? In what fact after this will they believe?<br>
186. Those whom Allah sendeth astray, there is no guide for them. He leaveth<br>
them to wander blindly on in their contumacy.<br>
187. They ask thee of the [destined] Hour, when will it come to port. Say:<br>
Knowledge thereof is with my Lord only. He alone will manifest it at its proper<br>
time. It is heavy in the heavens and the earth. It cometh not to you save<br>
unawares. They question thee as if thou couldst be well informed thereof. Say:<br>
Knowledge thereof is with Allah only, but most of mankind know not.<br>
188. Say: For myself I have no power to benefit, nor power to hurt, save that<br>
which Allah willeth. Had I knowledge of the Unseen, I should have abundance of<br>
wealth, and adversity would not touch me. I am but a warner, and a bearer of<br>
good tidings unto folk who believe.<br>
<br>
76<br>
<br>
189. He it is Who did create you from a single soul, and therefrom did make his<br>
mate that he might take rest in her. And when he covered her she bore a light<br>
burden, and she passed [unnoticed] with it, but when it became heavy they cried<br>
unto Allah, their Lord, saying: If thou givest unto us aright we shall be of the<br>
thankful.<br>
190. But when He gave unto them aright, they ascribed unto Him partners in<br>
respect of that which He had given them. High is He Exalted above all that they<br>
associate [with Him].<br>
191. Attribute they as partners to Allah those who created naught, but are<br>
themselves created,<br>
192. And cannot give them help, nor can they help themselves?<br>
193. And if ye call them to the Guidance, they follow you not. Whether ye call<br>
them or are silent is all one for you.<br>
194. Lo! those on whom ye call beside Allah are slaves like unto you. Call on<br>
them now, and let them answer you, if ye are truthful!<br>
195. Have they feet wherewith they walk, or have they hands wherewith they hold,<br>
or have they eyes wherewith they see, or have they ears wherewith they hear?<br>
Say: Call upon your [so-called] partners [of Allah], and then contrive against<br>
me, spare me not!<br>
196. Lo! my Protecting Friend is Allah Who revealeth the Scripture. He<br>
befriendeth the righteous.<br>
197. They on whom ye call beside Him have no power to help you, nor can they<br>
help you, nor can they help themselves.<br>
198. And if ye [Muslims] call them to the guidance they hear not; and thou<br>
[Muhammad] seest them looking toward thee, but they see not.<br>
199. Keep to forgiveness [O Muhammad], and enjoin kindness, and turn away from<br>
the ignorant.<br>
200. And if a slander from the devil wound thee, then seek refuge in Allah. Lo!<br>
He is Hearer, Knower.<br>
201. Lo! those who ward off [evil], when a glamour from the devil troubleth<br>
them, they do but remember [Allah's Guidance] and behold them seers!<br>
202. Their brethren plunge them further into error and cease not.<br>
203. And when thou bringest not a verse for them they say: Why hast thou not<br>
chosen it? Say: I follow only that which is inspired in me from my Lord. This<br>
[Qur'an] is insight from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy for a people that<br>
believe.<br>
204. And when the Qur'an is recited, give ear to it and pay heed, that ye may<br>
obtain mercy.<br>
205. And do thou [O Muhammad] remember thy Lord within thyself humbly and with<br>
awe, below thy breath, at morn and evening. And be not thou of the neglectful.<br>
206. Lo! those who are with thy Lord are not too proud to do Him service, but<br>
they praise Him and prostrate before Him.<br>
<br>
SURA 8. AL-ANFAL (SPOILS OF WAR, BOOTY)<br>
1. They ask thee [O Muhammad] of the spoils of war. Say: The spoils of war<br>
belong to Allah and the messenger, so keep your duty to Allah, and adjust the<br>
77<br>
<br>
matter of your difference, and obey Allah and His messenger, if ye are [true]<br>
believers.<br>
2. They only are the [true] believers whose hearts feel fear when Allah is<br>
mentioned, and when His revelations are recited unto them they increase their<br>
faith, and who trust in their Lord;<br>
3. Who establish worship and spend of that We have bestowed on them.<br>
4. Those are they who are in truth believers. For them are grades [of honour]<br>
with their Lord, and pardon, and a bountiful provision.<br>
5. Even as thy Lord caused thee [Muhammad] to go forth from thy home with the<br>
Truth, and lo! a party of the believers were averse [to it].<br>
6. Disputing with thee of the Truth after it had been made manifest, as if they<br>
were being driven to death visible.<br>
7. And when Allah promised you one of the two bands [of the enemy] that it<br>
should be yours, and ye longed that other than the armed one might be yours. And<br>
Allah willed that He should cause the Truth to triumph by His words, and cut the<br>
root of the disbelievers;<br>
8. That He might cause the Truth to triumph and bring vanity to naught, however<br>
much the guilty might oppose;<br>
9. When ye sought help of your Lord and He answered you [saying]: I will help<br>
you with a thousand of the angels, rank on rank.<br>
10. Allah appointed it only as good tidings, and that your hearts thereby might<br>
be at rest. Victory cometh only by the help of Allah. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Wise.<br>
11. When He made the slumber fall upon you as a reassurance from him and sent<br>
down water from the sky upon you, that thereby He might purify you, and remove<br>
from you the fear of Satan, and make strong your hearts and firm [your] feet<br>
thereby.<br>
12. When thy Lord inspired the angels, [saying]: I am with you. So make those<br>
who believe stand firm. I will throw fear into the hearts of those who<br>
disbelieve. Then smite the necks and smite of them each finger.<br>
13. That is because they opposed Allah and His messenger. Whoso opposeth Allah<br>
and His messenger, [for him] lo! Allah is severe in punishment.<br>
14. That [is the award], so taste it, and [know] that for disbelievers is the<br>
torment of the Fire.<br>
15. O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your<br>
backs to them.<br>
16. Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless manoeuvring for battle or<br>
intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his<br>
habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end.<br>
17. Ye [Muslims] slew them not, but Allah slew them. And thou [Muhammad]<br>
threwest not when thou didst throw, but Allah threw, that He might test the<br>
believers by a fair test from Him. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower.<br>
18. That [is the case]; and [know] that Allah [it is] Who maketh weak the plan<br>
of disbelievers.<br>
19. [O Qureysh!] If ye sought a judgment, now hath the judgment come unto you.<br>
And if ye cease [from persecuting the believers] it will be better for you, but<br>
if ye return [to the attack] We also shall return. And your host will avail you<br>
<br>
78<br>
<br>
naught, however numerous it be, and [know] that Allah is with the believers [in<br>
His Guidance].<br>
20. O ye who believe! Obey Allah and His messenger, and turn not away from him<br>
when ye hear [him speak].<br>
21. Be not as those who say, we hear, and they hear not.<br>
22. Lo! the worst of beasts in Allah's sight are the deaf, the dumb, who have no<br>
sense.<br>
23. Had Allah known of any good in them He would have made them hear, but had He<br>
made them hear they would have turned away, averse.<br>
24. O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and the messenger when He calleth you to that<br>
which quickeneth you, and know that Allah cometh in between the man and his own<br>
heart, and that He it is unto Whom ye will be gathered.<br>
25. And guard yourselves against a chastisement which cannot fall exclusively on<br>
those of you who are wrong-doers, and know that Allah is severe in punishment.<br>
26. And remember, when ye were few and reckoned feeble in the land, and were in<br>
fear lest men should extirpate you, how He gave you refuge, and strengthened you<br>
with His help, and made provision of good things for you, that haply ye might be<br>
thankful.<br>
27. O ye who believe! Betray not Allah and His messenger, nor knowingly betray<br>
your trusts.<br>
28. And know that your possessions and your children are a test, and that with<br>
Allah is immense reward.<br>
29. O ye who believe! If ye keep your duty to Allah, He will give you<br>
discrimination [between right and wrong] and will rid you of your evil thoughts<br>
and deeds, and will forgive you. Allah is of Infinite Bounty.<br>
30. And when those who disbelieve plot against thee [O Muhammad] to wound thee<br>
fatally, or to kill thee or to drive thee forth; they plot, but Allah [also]<br>
plotteth; and Allah is the best of plotters.<br>
31. And when Our revelations are recited unto them they say: We have heard. If<br>
we wish we can speak the like of this. Lo! this is naught but fables of the men<br>
of old.<br>
32. And when they said: O Allah! If this be indeed the truth from Thee, then<br>
rain down stones on us or bring on us some painful doom!<br>
33. But Allah would not punish them while thou wast with them, nor will He<br>
punish them while they seek forgiveness.<br>
34. What [plea] have they that Allah should not punish them, when they debar<br>
[His servants] from the Inviolable Place of Worship, though they are not its<br>
fitting guardians. Its fitting guardians are those only who keep their duty to<br>
Allah. But most of them know not.<br>
35. And their worship at the [holy] House is naught but whistling and handclapping. Therefore [it is said unto them]: Taste of the doom because ye<br>
disbelieve.<br>
36. Lo! those who disbelieve spend their wealth in order that they may debar<br>
[men] from the way of Allah. They will spend it, then it will become an anguish<br>
for them, then they will be conquered. And those who disbelieve will be gathered<br>
unto hell,<br>
<br>
79<br>
<br>
37. That Allah may separate the wicked from the good, The wicked will He place<br>
piece upon piece, and heap them all together, and consign them unto hell. Such<br>
verily are the losers.<br>
38. Tell those who disbelieve that if they cease [from persecution of believers]<br>
that which is past will be forgiven them; but if they return [thereto] then the<br>
example of the men of old hath already gone [before them, for a warning].<br>
39. And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is all for Allah.<br>
But if they cease, then lo! Allah is Seer of what they do.<br>
40. And if they turn away, then know that Allah is your Befriender - a<br>
Transcendent Patron, a Transcendent Helper!<br>
41. And know that whatever ye take as spoils of war, lo! a fifth thereof is for<br>
Allah, and for the messenger and for the kinsman [who hath need] and orphans and<br>
the needy and the wayfarer, if ye believe in Allah and that which We revealed<br>
unto Our slave on the Day of Discrimination, the day when the two armies met.<br>
And Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
42. When ye were on the near bank [of the valley] and they were on the yonder<br>
bank, and the caravan was below you [on the coast plain]. And had ye trysted to<br>
meet one another ye surely would have failed to keep the tryst, but [it<br>
happened, as it did, without the forethought of either of you] that Allah might<br>
conclude a thing that must be done; that he who perished [on that day] might<br>
perish by a clear proof [of His Sovereignty] and he who survived might survive<br>
by a clear proof [of His Sovereignty]. Lo! Allah in truth is Hearer, Knower.<br>
43. When Allah showed them unto thee [O Muhammad] in thy dream as few in number,<br>
and if He had shown them to thee as many, ye [Muslims] would have faltered and<br>
would have quarrelled over the affair. But Allah saved [you]. Lo! He knoweth<br>
what is in the breasts [of men].<br>
44. And when He made you [Muslims], when ye met [them], see them with your eyes<br>
as few, and lessened you in their eyes, [it was] that Allah might conclude a<br>
thing that must be done. Unto Allah all things are brought back.<br>
45. O ye who believe! When ye meet an army, hold firm and think of Allah much,<br>
that ye may be successful.<br>
46. And obey Allah and His messenger, and dispute not one with another lest ye<br>
falter and your strength depart from you; but be steadfast! Lo! Allah is with<br>
the steadfast.<br>
47. Be not as those who came forth from their dwellings boastfully and to be<br>
seen of men, and debar [men] from the way of Allah, while Allah is surrounding<br>
all they do.<br>
48. And when Satan made their deeds seem fair to them and said: No-one of<br>
mankind can conquer you this day, for I am your protector. But when the armies<br>
came in sight of one another, he took flight, saying: Lo! I am guiltless of you.<br>
Lo! I see that which ye see not. Lo! I fear Allah. And Allah is severe in<br>
punishment.<br>
49. When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease said: Their<br>
religion hath deluded these. Whoso putteth his trust in Allah [will find that]<br>
lo! Allah is Mighty, Wise.<br>
50. If thou couldst see how the angels receive those who disbelieve, smiting<br>
faces and their backs and [saying]: Taste the punishment of burning!<br>
51. This is for that which your own hands have sent before [to the Judgment],<br>
and [know] that Allah is not a tyrant to His slaves.<br>
<br>
80<br>
<br>
52. [Their way is] as the way of Pharaoh's folk and those before them; they<br>
disbelieved the revelations of Allah, and Allah took them in their sins. Lo!<br>
Allah is Strong, severe in punishment.<br>
53. That is because Allah never changeth the grace He hath bestowed on any<br>
people until they first change that which is in their hearts, and [that is]<br>
because Allah is Hearer, Knower.<br>
54. [Their way is] as the way of Pharaoh's folk and those before them; they<br>
denied the revelations of their Lord, so We destroyed them in their sins. And We<br>
drowned the folk of Pharaoh. All were evil-doers.<br>
55. Lo! the worst of beasts in Allah's sight are the ungrateful who will not<br>
believe.<br>
56. Those of them with whom thou madest a treaty, and then at every opportunity<br>
they break their treaty, and they keep not duty [to Allah].<br>
57. If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in<br>
those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.<br>
58. And if thou fearest treachery from any folk, then throw back to them [their<br>
treaty] fairly. Lo! Allah loveth not the treacherous.<br>
59. And let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip [Allah's<br>
Purpose]. Lo! they cannot escape.<br>
60. Make ready for them all thou canst of [armed] force and of horses tethered,<br>
that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of Allah and your enemy, and others beside<br>
them whom ye know not. Allah knoweth them. Whatsoever ye spend in the way of<br>
Allah it will be repaid to you in full, and ye will not be wronged.<br>
61. And if they incline to peace, incline thou also to it, and trust in Allah.<br>
Lo! He, even He, is the Hearer, the Knower.<br>
62. And if they would deceive thee, then lo! Allah is Sufficient for thee. He it<br>
is Who supporteth thee with His help and with the believers,<br>
63. And [as for the believers] hath attuned their hearts. If thou hadst spent<br>
all that is in the earth thou couldst not have attuned their hearts, but Allah<br>
hath attuned them. Lo! He is Mighty, Wise.<br>
64. O Prophet! Allah is Sufficient for thee and those who follow thee of the<br>
believers.<br>
65. O Prophet! Exhort the believers to fight. If there be of you twenty<br>
steadfast they shall overcome two hundred, and if there be of you a hundred<br>
[steadfast] they shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they<br>
[the disbelievers] are a folk without intelligence.<br>
66. Now hath Allah lightened your burden, for He knoweth that there is weakness<br>
in you. So if there be of you a steadfast hundred they shall overcome two<br>
hundred, and if there be of you a thousand [steadfast] they shall overcome two<br>
thousand by permission of Allah. Allah is with the steadfast.<br>
67. It is not for any prophet to have captives until he hath made slaughter in<br>
the land. Ye desire the lure of this world and Allah desireth [for you] the<br>
Hereafter, and Allah is Mighty, Wise.<br>
68. Had it not been for an ordinance of Allah which had gone before, an awful<br>
doom had come upon you on account of what ye took.<br>
69. Now enjoy what ye have won, as lawful and good, and keep your duty to Allah.<br>
Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
<br>
81<br>
<br>
70. O Prophet! Say unto those captives who are in your hands: If Allah knoweth<br>
any good in your hearts He will give you better than that which hath been taken<br>
from you, and will forgive you. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
71. And if they would betray thee, they betrayed Allah before, and He gave<br>
[thee] power over them. Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
72. Lo! those who believed and left their homes and strove with their wealth and<br>
their lives for the cause of Allah, and those who took them in and helped them:<br>
these are protecting friends one of another. And those who believed but did not<br>
leave their homes, ye have no duty to protect them till they leave their homes;<br>
but if they seek help from you in the matter of religion then it is your duty to<br>
help [them] except against a folk between whom and you there is a treaty. Allah<br>
is Seer of what ye do.<br>
73. And those who disbelieve are protectors one of another - If ye do not so,<br>
there will be confusion in the land, and great corruption.<br>
74. Those who believed and left their homes and strove for the cause of Allah,<br>
and those who took them in and helped them - these are the believers in truth.<br>
For them is pardon, and bountiful provision.<br>
75. And those who afterwards believed and left their homes and strove along with<br>
you, they are of you; and those who are akin are nearer one to another in the<br>
ordinance of Allah. Lo! Allah is Knower of all things.<br>
<br>
SURA 9. AT-TAWBA (REPENTANCE, DISPENSATION)<br>
1. Freedom from obligation [is proclaimed] from Allah and His messenger toward<br>
those of the idolaters with whom ye made a treaty.<br>
2. Travel freely in the land four months, and know that ye cannot escape Allah<br>
and that Allah will confound the disbelievers [in His Guidance].<br>
3. And a proclamation from Allah and His messenger to all men on the day of the<br>
Greater Pilgrimage that Allah is free from obligation to the idolaters, and [so<br>
is] His messenger. So, if ye repent, it will be better for you; but if ye are<br>
averse, then know that ye cannot escape Allah. Give tidings [O Muhammad] of a<br>
painful doom to those who disbelieve,<br>
4. Excepting those of the idolaters with whom ye [Muslims] have a treaty, and<br>
who have since abated nothing of your right nor have supported anyone against<br>
you. [As for these], fulfil their treaty to them till their term. Lo! Allah<br>
loveth those who keep their duty [unto Him].<br>
5. Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find<br>
them, and take them [captive], and besiege them, and prepare for them each<br>
ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then<br>
leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
6. And if anyone of the idolaters seeketh thy protection [O Muhammad], then<br>
protect him so that he may hear the Word of Allah, and afterward convey him to<br>
his place of safety. That is because they are a folk who know not.<br>
7. How can there be a treaty with Allah and with His messenger for the idolaters<br>
save those with whom ye made a treaty at the Inviolable Place of Worship? So<br>
long as they are true to you, be true to them. Lo! Allah loveth those who keep<br>
their duty.<br>
8. How [can there be any treaty for the others] when, if they have the upper<br>
hand of you, they regard not pact nor honour in respect of you? They satisfy you<br>
<br>
82<br>
<br>
with their mouths the while their hearts refuse. And most of them are<br>
wrongdoers.<br>
9. They have purchased with the revelations of Allah a little gain, so they<br>
debar [men] from His way. Lo! evil is that which they are wont to do.<br>
10. And they observe toward a believer neither pact nor honour. These are they<br>
who are transgressors.<br>
11. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then are they<br>
your brethren in religion. We detail Our revelations for a people who have<br>
knowledge.<br>
12. And if they break their pledges after their treaty [hath been made with you]<br>
and assail your religion, then fight the heads of disbelief - Lo! they have no<br>
binding oaths - in order that they may desist.<br>
13. Will ye not fight a folk who broke their solemn pledges, and purposed to<br>
drive out the messenger and did attack you first? What! Fear ye them? Now Allah<br>
hath more right that ye should fear Him, if ye are believers<br>
14. Fight them! Allah will chastise them at your hands, and He will lay them low<br>
and give you victory over them, and He will heal the breasts of folk who are<br>
believers.<br>
15. And He will remove the anger of their hearts. Allah relenteth toward whom He<br>
will. Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
16. Or deemed ye that ye would be left [in peace] when Allah yet knoweth not<br>
those of you who strive, choosing for familiar none save Allah and His messenger<br>
and the believers? Allah is Informed of what ye do.<br>
17. It is not for the idolaters to tend Allah's sanctuaries, bearing witness<br>
against themselves of disbelief. As for such, their works are vain and in the<br>
Fire they will abide.<br>
18. He only shall tend Allah's sanctuaries who believeth in Allah and the Last<br>
Day and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor-due and feareth none save<br>
Allah. For such [only] is it possible that they can be of the rightly guided.<br>
19. Count ye the slaking of a pilgrim's thirst and tendance of the Inviolable<br>
Place of Worship as [equal to the worth of] him who believeth in Allah and the<br>
Last Day, and striveth in the way of Allah? They are not equal in the sight of<br>
Allah. Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.<br>
20. Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth<br>
and their lives in Allah's way are of much greater worth in Allah's sight. These<br>
are they who are triumphant.<br>
21. Their Lord giveth them good tidings of mercy from Him, and acceptance, and<br>
Gardens where enduring pleasure will be theirs;<br>
22. There they will abide for ever. Lo! with Allah there is immense reward.<br>
23. O ye who believe! Choose not your fathers nor your brethren for friends if<br>
they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith. Whoso of you taketh them for<br>
friends, such are wrong-doers.<br>
24. Say: If your fathers, and your sons, and your brethren, and your wives, and<br>
your tribe, and the wealth ye have acquired, and merchandise for which ye fear<br>
that there will no sale, and dwellings ye desire are dearer to you than Allah<br>
and His messenger and striving in His way: then wait till Allah bringeth His<br>
command to pass. Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.<br>
<br>
83<br>
<br>
25. Allah hath given you victory on many fields and on the day of Huneyn, when<br>
ye exulted in your multitude but it availed you naught, and the earth, vast as<br>
it is, was straitened for you; then ye turned back in flight;<br>
26. Then Allah sent His peace of reassurance down upon His messenger and upon<br>
the believers, and sent down hosts ye could not see, and punished those who<br>
disbelieved. Such is the reward of disbelievers.<br>
27. Then afterward Allah will relent toward whom He will; for Allah is<br>
Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
28. O ye who believe! The idolaters only are unclean. So let them not come near<br>
the Inviolable Place of Worship after this their year. If ye fear poverty [from<br>
the loss of their merchandise] Allah shall preserve you of His bounty if He<br>
will. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
29. Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as believe not<br>
in Allah nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His<br>
messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the tribute<br>
readily, being brought low.<br>
30. And<br>
Messiah<br>
imitate<br>
against<br>
<br>
the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah, and the Christians say: The<br>
is the son of Allah. That is their saying with their mouths. They<br>
the saying of those who disbelieved of old. Allah [Himself] fighteth<br>
them. How perverse are they!<br>
<br>
31. They have taken as lords beside Allah their rabbis and their monks and the<br>
Messiah son of Mary, when they were bidden to worship only One Allah. There is<br>
no Allah save Him. Be He Glorified from all that they ascribe as partner [unto<br>
Him]!<br>
32. Fain would they put out the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah<br>
disdaineth [aught] save that He shall perfect His light, however much the<br>
disbelievers are averse.<br>
33. He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the Religion of<br>
Truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion, however much the<br>
idolaters may be averse.<br>
34. O ye who believe! Lo! many of the [Jewish] rabbis and the [Christian] monks<br>
devour the wealth of mankind wantonly and debar [men] from the way of Allah.<br>
They who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah, unto<br>
them give tidings [O Muhammad] of a painful doom,<br>
35. On the day when it will [all] be heated in the fire of hell, and their<br>
foreheads and their flanks and their backs will be branded therewith [and it<br>
will be said unto them]: Here is that which ye hoarded for yourselves. Now taste<br>
of what ye used to hoard.<br>
36. Lo! the number of the months with Allah is twelve months by Allah's<br>
ordinance in the day that He created the heavens and the earth. Four of them are<br>
sacred: that is the right religion. So wrong not yourselves in them. And wage<br>
war on all of the idolaters as they are waging war on all of you. And know that<br>
Allah is with those who keep their duty [unto Him].<br>
37. Postponement [of a sacred month] is only an excess of disbelief whereby<br>
those who disbelieve are misled; they allow it one year and forbid it [another]<br>
year, that they may make up the number of the months which Allah hath hallowed,<br>
so that they allow that which Allah hath forbidden. The evil of their deeds is<br>
made fairseeming unto them. Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk.<br>
38. O ye who believe! What aileth you that when it is said unto you: Go forth in<br>
the way of Allah, ye are bowed down to the ground with heaviness. Take ye<br>
<br>
84<br>
<br>
pleasure in the life of the world rather than in the Hereafter? The comfort of<br>
the life of the world is but little in the Hereafter.<br>
39. If ye go not forth He will afflict you with a painful doom, and will choose<br>
instead of you a folk other than you. Ye cannot harm Him at all. Allah is Able<br>
to do all things.<br>
40. If ye help him not, still Allah helped him when those who disbelieve drove<br>
him forth, the second of two; when they two were in the cave, when he said unto<br>
his comrade: Grieve not. Lo! Allah is with us. Then Allah caused His peace of<br>
reassurance to descend upon him and supported him with hosts ye cannot see, and<br>
made the word of those who disbelieved the nethermost, while Allah's Word it was<br>
that became the uppermost. Allah is Mighty, Wise.<br>
41. Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed, and strive with your wealth and your<br>
lives in the way of Allah! That is best for you if ye but knew.<br>
42. Had it been a near adventure and an easy journey they had followed thee, but<br>
the distance seemed too far for them. Yet will they swear by Allah [saying]: If<br>
we had been able we would surely have set out with you. They destroy their<br>
souls, and Allah knoweth that they verily are liars.<br>
43. Allah forgive thee [O Muhammad]! Wherefor didst thou grant them leave ere<br>
those who told the truth were manifest to thee and thou didst know the liars?<br>
44. Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day ask no leave of thee lest they<br>
should strive with their wealth and their lives. Allah is Aware of those who<br>
keep their duty [unto Him].<br>
45. They alone ask leave of thee who believe not in Allah and the Last Day, and<br>
whose hearts feel doubt, so in their doubt they waver.<br>
46. And if they had wished to go forth they would assuredly have made ready some<br>
equipment, but Allah was averse to their being sent forth and held them back and<br>
it was said [unto them]: Sit ye with the sedentary!<br>
47. Had they gone forth among you they had added to you naught save trouble and<br>
had hurried to and fro among you, seeking to cause sedition among you; and among<br>
you there are some who would have listened to them. Allah is Aware of evildoers.<br>
48. Aforetime they sought to cause sedition and raised difficulties for thee<br>
till the Truth came and the decree of Allah was made manifest, though they were<br>
loth.<br>
49. Of them is he who saith: Grant me leave [to stay at home] and tempt me not.<br>
Surely it is into temptation that they [thus] have fallen. Lo! hell verily is<br>
all around the disbelievers.<br>
50. If good befalleth thee [O Muhammad] it afflicteth them, and if calamity<br>
befalleth thee, they say: We took precaution, and they turn away well pleased.<br>
51. Say: Naught befalleth us save that which Allah hath decreed for us. He is<br>
our Protecting Friend. In Allah let believers put their trust!<br>
52. Say: Can ye await for us aught save one of two good things [death or victory<br>
in Allah's way]? while we await for you that Allah will afflict you with a doom<br>
from Him or at our hands. Await then! Lo! We are awaiting with you.<br>
53. Say: Pay [your contribution], willingly or unwillingly, it will not be<br>
accepted from you. Lo! ye were ever froward folk.<br>
<br>
85<br>
<br>
54. And naught preventeth that their contributions should be accepted from them<br>
save that they have disbelieved in Allah and in His messenger, and they come not<br>
to worship save as idlers, and pay not [their contribution] save reluctantly.<br>
55. So let not their riches nor their children please thee [O Muhammad]. Allah<br>
thereby intendeth but to punish them in the life of the world and that their<br>
souls shall pass away while they are disbelievers.<br>
56. And they swear by Allah that they are in truth of you, when they are not of<br>
you, but they are folk who are afraid.<br>
57. Had they but found a refuge, or caverns, or a place to enter, they surely<br>
had resorted thither swift as runaways.<br>
58. And of them is he who defameth thee in the matter of the alms. If they are<br>
given thereof they are content, and if they are not given thereof, behold! they<br>
are enraged.<br>
59. [How much more seemly] had they been content with that which Allah and His<br>
messenger had given them and had said: Allah sufficeth us. Allah will give us of<br>
His bounty, and [also] His messenger. Unto Allah we are suppliants.<br>
60. The alms are only for the poor and the needy, and those who collect them,<br>
and those whose hearts are to be reconciled, and to free the captives and the<br>
debtors, and for the cause of Allah, and [for] the wayfarer; a duty imposed by<br>
Allah. Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
61. And of them are those who vex the Prophet and say: He is only a hearer. Say:<br>
A hearer of good for you, who believeth in Allah and is true to the believers,<br>
and a mercy for such of you as believe. Those who vex the messenger of Allah,<br>
for them there is a painful doom.<br>
62. They swear by Allah to you [Muslims] to please you, but Allah, with His<br>
messenger, hath more right that they should please Him if they are believers.<br>
63. Know they not that whoso opposeth Allah and His messenger, his verily is<br>
fire of hell, to abide therein? That is the extreme abasement.<br>
64. The hypocrites fear lest a surah should be revealed concerning them,<br>
proclaiming what is in their hearts. Say: Scoff [your fill]! Lo! Allah is<br>
disclosing what ye fear.<br>
65. And if thou ask them [O Muhammad] they will say: We did but talk and jest.<br>
Say: Was it at Allah and His revelations and His messenger that ye did scoff?<br>
66. Make no excuse. Ye have disbelieved after your [confession of] belief. If We<br>
forgive a party of you, a party of you We shall punish because they have been<br>
guilty.<br>
67. The hypocrites, both men and women, proceed one from another. They enjoin<br>
the wrong, and they forbid the right, and they withhold their hands [from<br>
spending for the cause of Allah]. They forget Allah, so He hath forgotten them.<br>
Lo! the hypocrites, they are the transgressors.<br>
68. Allah promiseth the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers<br>
fire of hell for their abode. It will suffice them. Allah curseth them, and<br>
theirs is lasting torment.<br>
69. Even as those before you who were mightier than you in strength, and more<br>
affluent than you in wealth and children. They enjoyed their lot awhile, so ye<br>
enjoy your lot awhile even as those before you did enjoy their lot awhile. And<br>
ye prate even as they prated. Such are they whose works have perished in the<br>
world and the Hereafter. Such are they who are the losers.<br>
<br>
86<br>
<br>
70. Hath not the fame of those before them reached them - the folk of Noah,<br>
A'ad, Thamud, the folk of Abraham, the dwellers of Midian and the disasters<br>
[which befell them]? Their messengers [from Allah] came unto them with proofs<br>
[of Allah's Sovereignty]. So Allah surely wronged them not, but they did wrong<br>
themselves.<br>
71. And the believers, men and women, are protecting friends one of another;<br>
they enjoin the right and forbid the wrong, and they establish worship and they<br>
pay the poor-due, and they obey Allah and His messenger. As for these, Allah<br>
will have mercy on them. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Wise.<br>
72. Allah promiseth to the believers, men and women, Gardens underneath which<br>
rivers flow, wherein they will abide - blessed dwellings in Gardens of Eden. And<br>
- greater [far]! - acceptance from Allah. That is the supreme triumph.<br>
73. O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites! Be harsh with<br>
them. Their ultimate abode is hell, a hapless journey's end.<br>
74. They swear by Allah that they said nothing [wrong], yet they did say the<br>
word of disbelief, and did disbelieve after their Surrender [to Allah]. And they<br>
purposed that which they could not attain, and they sought revenge only that<br>
Allah by His messenger should enrich them of His bounty. If they repent it will<br>
be better for them; and if they turn away, Allah will afflict them with a<br>
painful doom in the world and the Hereafter, and they have no protecting friend<br>
nor helper in the earth.<br>
75. And of them is he who made a covenant with Allah [saying]: If He give us of<br>
His bounty we will give alms and become of the righteous.<br>
76. Yet when He gave them of His bounty, they hoarded it and turned away,<br>
averse;<br>
77. So He hath made the consequence [to be] hypocrisy in their hearts until the<br>
day when they shall meet Him, because they broke their word to Allah that they<br>
promised Him, and because they lied.<br>
78. Know they not that Allah knoweth both their secret and the thought that they<br>
confide, and that Allah is the Knower of Things Hidden?<br>
79. Those who point at such of the believers as give the alms willingly and such<br>
as can find naught to give but their endeavours, and deride them - Allah<br>
[Himself] derideth them. Theirs will be a painful doom.<br>
80. Ask forgiveness for them [O Muhammad], or ask not forgiveness for them;<br>
though thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times Allah will not forgive them.<br>
That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His messenger, and Allah guideth<br>
not wrongdoing folk.<br>
81. Those who were left behind rejoiced at sitting still behind the messenger of<br>
Allah, and were averse to striving with their wealth and their lives in Allah's<br>
way. And they said: Go not forth in the heat! Say: The fire of hell is more<br>
intense of heat, if they but understood.<br>
82. Then let them laugh a little: they will weep much, as the reward of what<br>
they used to earn.<br>
83. If Allah bring thee back [from the campaign] unto a party of them and they<br>
ask of thee leave to go out [to fight], then say unto them: Ye shall never more<br>
go out with me nor fight with me against a foe. Ye were content with sitting<br>
still the first time. So sit still, with the useless.<br>
<br>
87<br>
<br>
84. And never [O Muhammad] pray for one of them who dieth, nor stand by his<br>
grave. Lo! they disbelieved in Allah and His messenger, and they died while they<br>
were evil-doers.<br>
85. Let not their wealth nor their children please thee! Allah purposeth only to<br>
punish them thereby in the world, and that their souls shall pass away while<br>
they are disbelievers.<br>
86. And when a surah is revealed [which saith]: Believe in Allah and strive<br>
along with His messenger, the men of wealth among them still ask leave of thee<br>
and say: Suffer us to be with those who sit [at home].<br>
87. They are content that they should be with the useless and their hearts are<br>
sealed, so that they apprehend not.<br>
88. But the messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth<br>
and their lives. Such are they for whom are the good things. Such are they who<br>
are the successful.<br>
89. Allah hath made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein<br>
they will abide. That is the supreme triumph.<br>
90. And those among the wandering Arabs who had an excuse came in order that<br>
permission might be granted them. And those who lied to Allah and His messenger<br>
sat at home. A painful doom will fall on those of them who disbelieve.<br>
91. Not unto the weak nor unto the sick nor unto those who can find naught to<br>
spend is any fault [to be imputed though they stay at home] if they are true to<br>
Allah and His messenger. Not unto the good is there any road [of blame]. Allah<br>
is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
92. Nor unto those whom, when they came to thee [asking] that thou shouldst<br>
mount them, thou didst tell: I cannot find whereon to mount you. They turned<br>
back with eyes flowing with tears, for sorrow that they could not find the means<br>
to spend.<br>
93. The road [of blame] is only against those who ask for leave of thee [to stay<br>
at home] when they are rich. They are content to be with the useless. Allah hath<br>
sealed their hearts so that they know not.<br>
94. They will make excuse to you [Muslims] when ye return unto them. Say: Make<br>
no excuse, for we shall not believe you. Allah hath told us tidings of you.<br>
Allah and His messenger will see your conduct, and then ye will be brought back<br>
unto Him Who knoweth the Invisible as well as the Visible, and He will tell you<br>
what ye used to do.<br>
95. They will swear by Allah unto you, when ye return unto them, that ye may let<br>
them be. Let them be, for lo! they are unclean, and their abode is hell as the<br>
reward for what they used to earn.<br>
96. They swear unto you, that ye may accept them. Though ye accept them. Allah<br>
verily accepteth not wrongdoing folk.<br>
97. The wandering Arabs are more hard in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more<br>
likely to be ignorant of the limits which Allah hath revealed unto His<br>
messenger. And Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
98. And of the wandering Arabs there is he who taketh that which he expendeth<br>
[for the cause of Allah] as a loss, and awaiteth [evil] turns of fortune for you<br>
[that he may be rid of it]. The evil turn of fortune will be theirs. Allah is<br>
Hearer, Knower.<br>
99. And of the wandering Arabs there is he who believeth in Allah and the Last<br>
Day, and taketh that which he expendeth and also the prayers of the messenger as<br>
88<br>
<br>
acceptable offerings in the sight of Allah. Lo! verily it is an acceptable<br>
offering for them. Allah will bring them into His mercy. Lo! Allah is Forgiving,<br>
Merciful.<br>
100. And the<br>
who followed<br>
well pleased<br>
rivers flow,<br>
<br>
first to lead the way, of the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and those<br>
them in goodness - Allah is well pleased with them and they are<br>
with Him, and He hath made ready for them Gardens underneath which<br>
wherein they will abide for ever. That is the supreme triumph.<br>
<br>
101. And among those around you of the wandering Arabs there are hypocrites, and<br>
among the townspeople of Al-Madinah [there are some who] persist in hypocrisy<br>
whom thou [O Muhammad] knowest not. We, We know them, and We shall chastise them<br>
twice; then they will be relegated to a painful doom.<br>
102. And [there are] others who have acknowledged their faults. They mixed a<br>
righteous action with another that was bad. It may be that Allah will relent<br>
toward them. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
103. Take alms of their wealth, wherewith thou mayst purify them and mayst make<br>
them grow, and pray for them. Lo! thy prayer is an assuagement for them. Allah<br>
is Hearer, Knower.<br>
104. Know they not that Allah is He Who accepteth repentance from His bondmen<br>
and taketh the alms, and that Allah is He Who is the Relenting, the Merciful.<br>
105. And say [unto them]: Act! Allah will behold your actions, and [so will] His<br>
messenger and the believers, and ye will be brought back to the Knower of the<br>
Invisible and the Visible, and He will tell you what ye used to do.<br>
106. And [there are] others who await Allah's decree, whether He will punish<br>
them or will forgive them. Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
107. And as for those who chose a place of worship out of opposition<br>
disbelief, and in order to cause dissent among the believers, and as<br>
for those who warred against Allah and His messenger aforetime, they<br>
swear: We purposed naught save good. Allah beareth witness that they<br>
liars.<br>
<br>
and<br>
an outpost<br>
will surely<br>
verily are<br>
<br>
108. Never stand [to pray] there. A place of worship which was found upon duty<br>
[to Allah] from the first day is more worthy that thou shouldst stand [to pray]<br>
therein, wherein are men who love to purify themselves. Allah loveth the<br>
purifiers.<br>
109. Is he who founded his building upon duty to Allah and His good pleasure<br>
better; or he who founded his building on the brink of a crumbling, overhanging<br>
precipice so that it toppled with him into the fire of hell? Allah guideth not<br>
wrongdoing folk.<br>
110. The building which they built will never cease to be a misgiving in their<br>
hearts unless their hearts be torn to pieces. Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
111. Lo! Allah hath bought from the believers their lives and their wealth<br>
because the Garden will be theirs: they shall fight in the way of Allah and<br>
shall slay and be slain. It is a promise which is binding on Him in the Torah<br>
and the Gospel and the Qur'an. Who fulfilleth His covenant better than Allah?<br>
Rejoice then in your bargain that ye have made, for that is the supreme triumph.<br>
112. [Triumphant] are those who turn repentant [to Allah], those who serve<br>
[Him], those who praise [Him], those who fast, those who bow down, those who<br>
fall prostrate [in worship], those who enjoin the right and who forbid the wrong<br>
and those who keep the limits [ordained] of Allah - And give glad tidings to<br>
believers!<br>
<br>
89<br>
<br>
113. It is not for the Prophet, and those who believe, to pray for the<br>
forgiveness of idolaters even though they may be near of kin [to them] after it<br>
hath become clear that they are people of hell-fire.<br>
114. The prayer of Abraham for the forgiveness of his father was only because of<br>
a promise he had promised him, but when it had become clear unto him that he<br>
[his father] was an enemy to Allah he [Abraham] disowned him. Lo! Abraham was<br>
soft of heart, long-suffering.<br>
115. It was never Allah's [part] that He should send a folk astray after He had<br>
guided them until He had made clear unto them what they should avoid. Lo! Allah<br>
is Aware of all things.<br>
116. Lo! Allah! Unto Him belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth.<br>
He quickeneth and He giveth death. And ye have, instead of Allah, no protecting<br>
friend nor helper.<br>
117. Allah hath turned in mercy to the Prophet, and to the Muhajirin and the<br>
Ansar who followed him in the hour of hardship. After the hearts of a party of<br>
them had almost swerved aside, then turned He unto them in mercy. Lo! He is Full<br>
of Pity, Merciful for them.<br>
118. And to the three also [did He turn in mercy] who were left behind, when the<br>
earth, vast as it is, was straitened for them, and their own souls were<br>
straitened for them till they bethought them that there is no refuge from Allah<br>
save toward Him. Then turned He unto them in mercy that they [too] might turn<br>
[repentant unto Him]. Lo! Allah! He is the Relenting, the Merciful.<br>
119. O ye who believe! Be careful of your duty to Allah, and be with the<br>
truthful.<br>
120. It is not for the townsfolk of Al-Madinah and for those around them of the<br>
wandering Arabs so stay behind the messenger of Allah and prefer their lives to<br>
his life. That is because neither thirst nor toil nor hunger afflicteth them in<br>
the way of Allah, nor step they any step that angereth the disbelievers, nor<br>
gain they from the enemy a gain, but a good deed is recorded for them therefor.<br>
Lo! Allah loseth not the wages of the good.<br>
121. Nor spend they any spending, small or great, nor do they cross a valley,<br>
but it is recorded for them, that Allah may repay them the best of what they<br>
used to do.<br>
122. And the believers should not all go out to fight. Of every troop of them, a<br>
party only should go forth, that they [who are left behind] may gain sound<br>
knowledge in religion, and that they may warn their folk when they return to<br>
them, so that they may beware.<br>
123. O ye who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you, and<br>
let them find harshness in you, and know that Allah is with those who keep their<br>
duty [unto Him].<br>
124. And whenever a surah is revealed there are some of them who say: Which one<br>
of you hath thus increased in faith? As for those who believe, it hath increased<br>
them in faith and they rejoice [therefor].<br>
125. But as for those in whose hearts is disease, it only addeth wickedness to<br>
their wickedness, and they die while they are disbelievers.<br>
126. See they not that they are tested once or twice in every year? Still they<br>
turn not in repentance, neither pay they heed.<br>
<br>
90<br>
<br>
127. And whenever a surah is revealed, they look one at another [as who should<br>
say]: Doth anybody see you? Then they turn away. Allah turneth away their hearts<br>
because they are a folk who understand not.<br>
128. There hath come unto you a messenger, [one] of yourselves, unto whom aught<br>
that ye are overburdened is grievous, full of concern for you, for the believers<br>
full of pity, merciful.<br>
129. Now, if they turn away [O Muhammad] say: Allah sufficeth me. There is no<br>
Allah save Him. In Him have I put my trust, and He is Lord of the Tremendous<br>
Throne.<br>
<br>
SURA 10. YUNUS (JONAH)<br>
1. Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verses of the Wise Scripture.<br>
2. Is it a wonder for mankind that We have inspired a man among them, saying:<br>
Warn mankind and bring unto those who believe the good tidings that they have a<br>
sure footing with their Lord? The disbelievers say: Lo! this is a mere wizard.<br>
3. Lo! your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days,<br>
then He established Himself upon the Throne, directing all things. There is no<br>
intercessor [with Him] save after His permission. That is Allah, your Lord, so<br>
worship Him. Oh, will ye not remind?<br>
4. Unto Him is the return of all of you; it is a promise of Allah in truth. Lo!<br>
He produceth creation, then reproduceth it, that He may reward those who believe<br>
and do good works with equity; while, as for those who disbelieve, theirs will<br>
be a boiling drink and painful doom because they disbelieved.<br>
5. He it is Who appointed the sun a splendour and the moon a light, and measured<br>
for her stages, that ye might know the number of the years, and the reckoning.<br>
Allah created not [all] that save in truth. He detaileth the revelations for<br>
people who have knowledge.<br>
6. Lo! in the difference of day and night and all that Allah hath created in the<br>
heavens and the earth are portents, verily, for folk who ward off [evil].<br>
7. Lo! those who expect not the meeting with Us but desire the life of the world<br>
and feel secure therein, and those who are neglectful of Our revelations,<br>
8. Their home will be the Fire because of what they used to earn.<br>
9. Lo! those who believe and do good works, their Lord guideth them by their<br>
faith. Rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of Delight,<br>
10. Their prayer therein will be: Glory be to Thee, O Allah! and their greeting<br>
therein will be: Peace. And the conclusion of their prayer will be: Praise be to<br>
Allah, Lord of the Worlds!<br>
11. If Allah were to hasten on for men the ill [that they have earned] as they<br>
would hasten on the good, their respite would already have expired. But We<br>
suffer those who look not for the meeting with Us to wander blindly on in their<br>
contumacy.<br>
12. And if misfortune touch a man he crieth unto Us, [while reclining] on his<br>
side, or sitting or standing, but when We have relieved him of the misfortune he<br>
goeth his way as though he had not cried unto Us because of a misfortune that<br>
afflicted him. Thus is what they do made [seeming] fair unto the prodigal.<br>
<br>
91<br>
<br>
13. We destroyed the generations before you when they did wrong; and their<br>
messengers [from Allah] came unto them with clear proofs [of His Sovereignty]<br>
but they would not believe. Thus do We reward the guilty folk.<br>
14. Then We appointed you viceroys in the earth after them, that We might see<br>
how ye behave.<br>
15. And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, they who look not for<br>
the meeting with Us say: Bring a Lecture other than this, or change it. Say [O<br>
Muhammad]: It is not for me to change it of my accord. I only follow that which<br>
is inspired in me. Lo! if I disobey my Lord I fear the retribution of an awful<br>
Day.<br>
16. Say: If Allah had so willed I should not have recited it to you nor would He<br>
have made it known to you. I dwelt among you a whole lifetime before it [came to<br>
me]. Have ye then no sense?<br>
17. Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah and<br>
denieth His revelations? Lo! the guilty never are successful.<br>
18. They worship beside Allah that which neither hurteth them nor profiteth<br>
them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah. Say: Would ye inform<br>
Allah of [something] that He knoweth not in the heavens or in the earth? Praised<br>
be He and High Exalted above all that ye associate [with Him]!<br>
19. Mankind were but one community; then they differed; and had it not been for<br>
a word that had already gone forth from thy Lord it had been judged between them<br>
in respect of that wherein they differ.<br>
20. And they will say: If only a portent were sent down upon him from his Lord!<br>
Then say, [O Muhammad]: The Unseen belongeth to Allah. So wait! Lo! I am waiting<br>
with you.<br>
21. And when We cause mankind to taste of mercy after some adversity which had<br>
afflicted them, behold! they have some plot against Our revelations. Say: Allah<br>
is more swift in plotting. Lo! Our messengers write down that which ye plot.<br>
22. He it is Who maketh you to go on the land and the sea till, when ye are in<br>
the ships and they sail with them with a fair breeze and they are glad therein,<br>
a storm-wind reacheth them and the wave cometh unto them from every side and<br>
they deem that they are overwhelmed therein; [then] they cry unto Allah, making<br>
their faith pure for Him only: If Thou deliver us from this, we truly will be of<br>
the thankful.<br>
23. Yet when He hath delivered them, behold! they rebel in the earth wrongfully.<br>
O mankind! Your rebellion is only against yourselves. [Ye have] enjoyment of the<br>
life of the world; then unto Us is your return and We shall proclaim unto you<br>
what ye used to do.<br>
24. The similitude of the life of the world is only as water which We send down<br>
from the sky, then the earth's growth of that which men and cattle eat mingleth<br>
with it till, when the earth hath taken on her ornaments and is embellished, and<br>
her people deem that they are masters of her, Our commandment cometh by night or<br>
by day and We make it as reaped corn as if it had not flourished yesterday. Thus<br>
do we expound the revelations for people who reflect.<br>
25. And Allah summoneth to the abode of peace, and leadeth whom He will to a<br>
straight path.<br>
26. For those who do good is the best [reward] and more [thereto]. Neither dust<br>
nor ignominy cometh near their faces. Such are rightful owners of the Garden;<br>
they will abide therein.<br>
<br>
92<br>
<br>
27. And those who earn ill-deeds, [for them] requital of each ill-deed by the<br>
like thereof; and ignominy overtaketh them - They have no protector from Allah as if their faces had been covered with a cloak of darkest night. Such are<br>
rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein.<br>
28. On the day when We gather them all together, then We say unto those who<br>
ascribed partners [unto Us]: Stand back, ye and your [pretended] partners [of<br>
Allah]! And We separate them, the one from the other, and their [pretended]<br>
partners say: It was not us ye worshipped.<br>
29. Allah sufficeth as a witness between us and you, that we were unaware of<br>
your worship.<br>
30. There doth every soul experience that which it did aforetime, and they are<br>
returned unto Allah, their rightful Lord, and that which they used to invent<br>
hath failed them.<br>
31. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Who provideth for you from the sky and the<br>
earth, or Who owneth hearing and sight; and Who bringeth forth the living from<br>
the dead and bringeth forth the dead from the living; and Who directeth the<br>
course? They will say: Allah. Then say: Will ye not then keep your duty [unto<br>
Him]?<br>
32. Such then is Allah, your rightful Lord. After the Truth what is there saving<br>
error? How then are ye turned away!<br>
33. Thus is the Word of thy Lord justified concerning those who do wrong: that<br>
they believe not.<br>
34. Say: Is there of your partners [whom ye ascribe unto Allah] one that<br>
produceth Creation and then reproduceth it? Say: Allah produceth Creation, then<br>
reproduceth it. How then, are ye misled!<br>
35. Say: Is there of your partners [whom ye ascribe unto Allah] one that leadeth<br>
to the Truth? Say: Allah leadeth to the Truth. Is He Who leadeth to the Truth<br>
more deserving that He should be followed, or he who findeth not the way unless<br>
he [himself] be guided. What aileth you? How judge ye?<br>
36. Most of them follow not but conjecture. Assuredly conjecture can by no means<br>
take the place of truth. Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do.<br>
37. And this Qur'an is not such as could ever be invented in despite of Allah;<br>
but it is a confirmation of that which was before it and an exposition of that<br>
which is decreed for mankind - Therein is no doubt - from the Lord of the<br>
Worlds.<br>
38. Or say they: He hath invented it? Say: Then bring a surah like unto it, and<br>
call [for help] on all ye can besides Allah, if ye are truthful.<br>
39. Nay, but they denied that, the knowledge whereof they could not compass, and<br>
whereof the interpretation [in events] hath not yet come unto them. Even so did<br>
those before them deny. Then see what was the consequence for the wrong-doers!<br>
40. And of them is he who believeth therein, and of them is he who believeth not<br>
therein, and thy Lord is Best Aware of the corrupters.<br>
41. And if they deny thee, say: Unto me my work, and unto you your work. Ye are<br>
innocent of what I do, and I am innocent of what ye do.<br>
42. And of them are some who listen unto thee. But canst thou make the deaf to<br>
hear even though they apprehend not?<br>
43. And of them is he who looketh toward thee. But canst thou guide the blind<br>
even though they see not?<br>
<br>
93<br>
<br>
44. Lo! Allah wrongeth not mankind in aught; but mankind wrong themselves.<br>
45. And on the day when He shall gather them together, [when it will seem] as<br>
though they had tarried but an hour of the day, recognising one another, those<br>
will verily have perished who denied the meeting with Allah and were not guided.<br>
46. Whether We let thee [O Muhammad] behold something of that which We promise<br>
them or [whether We] cause thee to die, still unto Us is their return, and<br>
Allah, moreover, is Witness over what they do.<br>
47. And for every nation there is a messenger. And when their messenger cometh<br>
[on the Day of Judgment] it will be judged between them fairly, and they will<br>
not be wronged.<br>
48. And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful?<br>
49. Say: I have no power to hurt or benefit myself, save that which Allah<br>
willeth. For every nation there is an appointed time. When their time cometh,<br>
then they cannot put it off an hour, nor hasten [it].<br>
50. Say: Have ye thought: When His doom cometh unto you as a raid by night, or<br>
in the [busy] day; what is there of it that the guilty ones desire to hasten?<br>
51. Is it [only] then, when it hath befallen you, that ye will believe? What!<br>
[Believe] now, when [until now] ye have been hastening it on [through<br>
disbelief]?<br>
52. Then will it be said unto those who dealt unjustly Taste the torment of<br>
eternity. Are ye requited aught save what ye used to earn?<br>
53. And they ask thee to inform them [saying]: Is it true? Say: Yea, by my Lord,<br>
verily it is true, and ye cannot escape.<br>
54. And if each soul that doeth wrong had all that is in the earth it would seek<br>
to ransom itself therewith; and they will feel remorse within them, when they<br>
see the doom. But it hath been judged between them fairly and they are not<br>
wronged.<br>
55. Lo! verily all that is in the heavens and the earth is Allah's. Lo! verily<br>
Allah's promise is true. But most of them know not.<br>
56. He quickeneth and giveth death, and unto Him ye will be returned.<br>
57. O mankind! There hath come unto you an exhortation from your Lord, a balm<br>
for that which is in the breasts, a guidance and a mercy for believers.<br>
58. Say: In the bounty of Allah and in His mercy: therein let them rejoice. It<br>
is better than what they hoard.<br>
59. Say: Have ye considered what provision Allah hath sent down for you, how ye<br>
have made of it lawful and unlawful? Hath Allah permitted you, or do ye invent a<br>
lie concerning Allah?<br>
60. And what think those who invent a lie concerning Allah [will be their<br>
plight] upon the Day of Resurrection? Lo! Allah truly is Bountiful toward<br>
mankind, but most of them give not thanks.<br>
61. And thou [Muhammad] art not occupied with any business and thou recitest not<br>
a Lecture from this [Scripture], and ye [mankind] perform no act, but We are<br>
Witness of you when ye are engaged therein. And not an atom's weight in the<br>
earth or in the sky escapeth your Lord, nor what is less than that or greater<br>
than that, but it is [written] in a clear Book.<br>
62. Lo! verily the friends of Allah are [those] on whom fear [cometh] not, nor<br>
do they grieve?<br>
<br>
94<br>
<br>
63. Those who believe and keep their duty [to Allah].<br>
64. Theirs are good tidings in the life of the world and in the Hereafter There is no changing the Words of Allah - that is the Supreme Triumph.<br>
65. And let not their speech grieve thee [O Muhammad]. Lo! power belongeth<br>
wholly to Allah. He is the Hearer, the Knower.<br>
66. Lo! is it not unto Allah that belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and<br>
whosoever is in the earth? Those who follow aught instead of Allah follow not<br>
[His] partners. They follow only a conjecture, and they do but guess.<br>
67. He it is Who hath appointed for you the night that ye should rest therein<br>
and the day giving sight. Lo! herein verily are portents for a folk that heed.<br>
68. They say: Allah hath taken [unto Him] a son - Glorified be He! He hath no<br>
needs! His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Ye have<br>
no warrant for this. Tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not?<br>
69. Say: Verily those who invent a lie concerning Allah will not succeed.<br>
70. This world's portion [will be theirs], then unto Us is their return. Then We<br>
make them taste a dreadful doom because they used to disbelieve.<br>
71. Recite unto them the story of Noah, when he told his people: O my people! If<br>
my sojourn [here] and my reminding you by Allah's revelations are an offence<br>
unto you, in Allah have I put my trust, so decide upon your course of action you<br>
and your partners. Let not your course of action be in doubt for you. Then have<br>
at me, give me no respite.<br>
72. But if ye are averse I have asked of you no wage. My wage is the concern of<br>
Allah only, and I am commanded to be of those who surrender [unto Him].<br>
73. But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship, and<br>
made them viceroys [in the earth], while We drowned those who denied Our<br>
revelations. See then the nature of the consequence for those who had been<br>
warned.<br>
74. Then, after him, We sent messengers unto their folk, and they brought them<br>
clear proofs. But they were not ready to believe in that which they before<br>
denied. Thus print We on the hearts of the transgressors.<br>
75. Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aaron unto Pharaoh and his chiefs with<br>
Our revelations, but they were arrogant and were a guilty folk.<br>
76. And when the Truth from Our presence came unto them, they said: Lo! this is<br>
mere magic.<br>
77. Moses said: Speak ye [so] of the Truth when it hath come unto you? Is this<br>
magic? Now magicians thrive not.<br>
78. They said: Hast thou come unto us to pervert us from that [faith] in which<br>
we found our fathers, and that you two may own the place of greatness in the<br>
land? We will not believe you two.<br>
79. And Pharaoh said: Bring every cunning wizard unto me.<br>
80. And when the wizards came, Moses said unto them: Cast your cast!<br>
81. And when they had cast, Moses said: That which ye have brought is magic. Lo!<br>
Allah will make it vain. Lo! Allah upholdeth not the work of mischief-makers.<br>
82. And Allah will vindicate the Truth by His words, however much the guilty be<br>
averse.<br>
<br>
95<br>
<br>
83. But none trusted Moses, save some scions of his people, [and they were] in<br>
fear of Pharaoh and their chiefs, that he would persecute them. Lo! Pharaoh was<br>
verily a tyrant in the land, and lo! he verily was of the wanton.<br>
84. And Moses said: O my people! If ye have believed in Allah then put trust in<br>
Him, if ye have indeed surrendered [unto Him]!<br>
85. They said: In Allah we put trust. Our Lord! Oh, make us not a lure for the<br>
wrongdoing folk;<br>
86. And, of Thy mercy, save us from the folk that disbelieve.<br>
87. And We inspired Moses and his brother, [saying]: Appoint houses for your<br>
people in Egypt and make your houses oratories, and establish worship. And give<br>
good news to the believers.<br>
88. And Moses said: Our Lord! Lo! Thou hast given Pharaoh and his chiefs<br>
splendour and riches in the life of the world, Our Lord! that they may lead men<br>
astray from Thy way. Our Lord! Destroy their riches and harden their hearts so<br>
that they believe not till they see the painful doom.<br>
89. He said: Your prayer is heard. Do ye twain keep to the straight path, and<br>
follow not the road of those who have no knowledge.<br>
90. And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh with his<br>
hosts pursued them in rebellion and transgression, till, when the [fate of]<br>
drowning overtook him, he exclaimed: I believe that there is no Allah save Him<br>
in Whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of those who surrender [unto<br>
Him].<br>
91. What! Now! When hitherto thou hast rebelled and been of the wrong-doers?<br>
92. But this day We save thee in thy body that thou mayst be a portent for those<br>
after thee. Lo! most of mankind are heedless of Our portents.<br>
93. And We verily did allot unto the Children of Israel a fixed abode, and did<br>
provide them with good things; and they differed not until the knowledge came<br>
unto them. Lo! thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection<br>
concerning that wherein they used to differ.<br>
94. And if thou [Muhammad] art in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto<br>
thee, then question those who read the Scripture [that was] before thee. Verily<br>
the Truth from thy Lord hath come unto thee. So be not thou of the waverers.<br>
95. And be not thou of those who deny the revelations of Allah, for then wert<br>
thou of the losers.<br>
96. Lo! those for whom the word of thy Lord [concerning sinners] hath effect<br>
will not believe,<br>
97. Though every token come unto them, till they see the painful doom.<br>
98. If only there had been a community [of all those that were destroyed of old]<br>
that believed and profited by its belief as did the folk of Jonah! When they<br>
believed We drew off from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the world<br>
and gave them comfort for a while.<br>
99. And if thy Lord willed, all who are in the earth would have believed<br>
together. Wouldst thou [Muhammad] compel men until they are believers?<br>
100. It is not for any soul to believe save by the permission of Allah. He hath<br>
set uncleanness upon those who have no sense.<br>
101. Say: Behold what is in the heavens and the earth! But revelations and<br>
warnings avail not folk who will not believe.<br>
<br>
96<br>
<br>
102. What expect they save the like of the days of those who passed away before<br>
them? Say: Expect then! I am with you among the expectant.<br>
103. Then shall We save Our messengers and the believers, in like manner [as of<br>
old]. It is incumbent upon Us to save believers.<br>
104. Say [O Muhammad]: O mankind! If ye are in doubt of my religion, then [know<br>
that] I worship not those whom ye worship instead of Allah, but I worship Allah<br>
Who causeth you to die, and I have been commanded to be of the believers.<br>
105. And, [O Muhammad] set thy purpose resolutely for religion, as a man by<br>
nature upright, and be not of those who ascribe partners [to Allah].<br>
106. And cry not, beside Allah, unto that which cannot profit thee nor hurt<br>
thee, for if thou didst so then wert thou of the wrong-doers.<br>
107. If Allah afflicteth thee with some hurt, there is none who can remove it<br>
save Him; and if He desireth good for thee, there is none who can repel His<br>
bounty. He striketh with it whom He will of his bondmen. He is the Forgiving,<br>
the Merciful.<br>
108. Say: O mankind! Now hath the Truth from your Lord come unto you. So<br>
whosoever is guided, is guided only for [the good of] his soul, and whosoever<br>
erreth erreth only against it. And I am not a warder over you.<br>
109. And [O Muhammad] follow that which is inspired in thee, and forbear until<br>
Allah give judgment. And He is the Best of Judges.<br>
<br>
SURA 11. HUD (HUD)<br>
1. Alif. Lam. Ra. [This is] a Scripture the revelations whereof are perfected<br>
and then expounded. [It cometh] from One Wise, Informed,<br>
2. [Saying]: Serve none but Allah. Lo! I am unto you from Him a warner and a<br>
bringer of good tidings.<br>
3. And [bidding you]: Ask pardon of your Lord and turn to Him repentant. He will<br>
cause you to enjoy a fair estate until a time appointed. He giveth His bounty<br>
unto every bountiful one. But if ye turn away, lo! [then] I fear for you the<br>
retribution of an awful Day.<br>
4. Unto Allah is your return, and He is Able to do all things.<br>
5. Lo! now they fold up<br>
Him. At the very moment<br>
knoweth that which they<br>
Aware of what is in the<br>
<br>
their breasts that they may hide [their thoughts] from<br>
when they cover themselves with their clothing, Allah<br>
keep hidden and that which they proclaim. Lo! He is<br>
breasts [of men].<br>
<br>
6. And there is not a beast in the earth but the sustenance thereof dependeth on<br>
Allah. He knoweth its habitation and its repository. All is in a clear Record.<br>
7. And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and His<br>
Throne was upon the water - that He might try you, which of you is best in<br>
conduct. Yet if thou [O Muhammad] sayest: Lo! ye will be raised again after<br>
death! those who disbelieve will surely say: This is naught but mere magic.<br>
8. And if We delay for them the doom until a reckoned time, they will surely<br>
say: What withholdeth it? Verily on the day when it cometh unto them, it cannot<br>
be averted from them, and that which they derided will surround them.<br>
9. And if we cause man to taste some mercy from Us and afterward withdraw it<br>
from him, lo! he is despairing, thankless.<br>
<br>
97<br>
<br>
10. And if We cause him to taste grace after some misfortune that had befallen<br>
him, he saith: The ills have gone from me. Lo! he is exultant, boastful;<br>
11. Save those who persevere and do good works. Theirs will be forgiveness and a<br>
great reward.<br>
12. A likely thing, that thou wouldst forsake aught of that which hath been<br>
revealed unto thee, and that thy breast should be straitened for it, because<br>
they say: Why hath not a treasure been sent down for him, or an angel come with<br>
him? Thou art but a warner, and Allah is in charge of all things.<br>
13. Or they say: He hath invented it. Say: Then bring ten surahs, the like<br>
thereof, invented, and call on everyone ye can beside Allah, if ye are truthful!<br>
14. And if they answer not your prayer, then know that it is revealed only in<br>
the knowledge of Allah; and that there is no Allah save Him. Will ye then be<br>
[of] those who surrender?<br>
15. Whoso desireth the life of the world and its pomp, We shall repay them their<br>
deeds herein, and therein they will not be wronged.<br>
16. Those are they for whom is naught in the Hereafter save the Fire. [All] that<br>
they contrive here is vain and [all] that they are wont to do is fruitless.<br>
17. Is he [to be counted equal with them] who relieth on a clear proof from his<br>
Lord, and a witness from Him reciteth it, and before it was the Book of Moses,<br>
an example and a mercy? Such believe therein, and whoso disbelieveth therein of<br>
the clans, the Fire is his appointed place. So be not thou in doubt concerning<br>
it. Lo! it is the Truth from thy Lord; but most of mankind believe not.<br>
18. Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah? Such<br>
will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say: These are they<br>
who lied concerning their Lord. Now the curse of Allah is upon wrong-doers,<br>
19. Who debar [men] from the way of Allah and would have it crooked, and who are<br>
disbelievers in the Hereafter.<br>
20. Such will not escape in the earth, nor have they any protecting friends<br>
beside Allah. For them the torment will be double. They could not bear to hear,<br>
and they used not to see.<br>
21. Such are they who have lost their souls, and that which they used to invent<br>
hath failed them.<br>
22. Assuredly in the Hereafter they will be the greatest losers.<br>
23. Lo! those who believe and do good works and humble themselves before their<br>
Lord: such are rightful owners of the Garden; they will abide therein.<br>
24. The similitude of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf and the seer<br>
and the hearer. Are they equal in similitude? Will ye not then be admonished?<br>
25. And We sent Noah unto his folk [and he said]: Lo! I am a plain warner unto<br>
you.<br>
26. That ye serve none, save Allah. Lo! I fear for you the retribution of a<br>
painful Day.<br>
27. The chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved, said: We see thee but a mortal<br>
like us, and we see not that any follow thee save the most abject among us,<br>
without reflection. We behold in you no merit above us - nay, we deem you liars.<br>
28. He said: O my people! Bethink you, if I rely on a clear proof from my Lord<br>
and there hath come unto me a mercy from His presence, and it hath been made<br>
obscure to you, can we compel you to accept it when ye are averse thereto?<br>
<br>
98<br>
<br>
29. And O my people! I ask of you no wealth therefor. My reward is the concern<br>
only of Allah, and I am not going to thrust away those who believe - Lo! they<br>
have to meet their Lord! - but I see you a folk that are ignorant.<br>
30. And, O my people! who would deliver me from Allah if I thrust them away?<br>
Will ye not then reflect?<br>
31. I say not unto you: "I have the treasures of Allah" nor "I have knowledge of<br>
the Unseen," nor say I: "Lo! I am an angel!" Nor say I unto those whom your eyes<br>
scorn that Allah will not give them good - Allah knoweth best what is in their<br>
hearts - Lo! then indeed I should be of the wrong-doers.<br>
32. They said: O Noah! Thou hast disputed with us and multiplied disputation<br>
with us; now bring upon us that wherewith thou threatenest us, if thou art of<br>
the truthful.<br>
33. He said: Only Allah will bring it upon you if He will, and ye can by no<br>
means escape.<br>
34. My counsel will not profit you if I were minded to advise you, if Allah's<br>
will is to keep you astray. He is your Lord and unto Him ye will be brought<br>
back.<br>
35. Or say they [again]: He hath invented it? Say: If I have invented it, upon<br>
me be my crimes, but I am innocent of [all] that ye commit.<br>
36. And it was inspired in Noah, [saying]: No-one of thy folk will believe save<br>
him who hath believed already. Be not distressed because of what they do.<br>
37. Build the ship under Our eyes and by Our inspiration, and speak not unto Me<br>
on behalf of those who do wrong. Lo! they will be drowned.<br>
38. And he was building the ship, and every time that chieftains of his people<br>
passed him, they made mock of him. He said: Though ye make mock of Us, yet We<br>
mock at you even as ye mock;<br>
39. And ye shall know to whom a punishment that will confound him cometh, and<br>
upon whom a lasting doom will fall.<br>
40. [Thus it<br>
forth water,<br>
female], and<br>
already, and<br>
<br>
was] till, when Our commandment came to pass and the oven gushed<br>
We said: Load therein two of every kind, a pair [the male and<br>
thy household, save him against whom the word hath gone forth<br>
those who believe. And but a few were they who believed with him.<br>
<br>
41. And he said: Embark therein! In the name of Allah be its course and its<br>
mooring. Lo! my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
42. And it sailed with them amid waves like mountains, and Noah cried unto his<br>
son - and he was standing aloof - O my son! Come ride with us, and be not with<br>
the disbelievers.<br>
43. He said: I shall betake me to some mountain that will save me from the<br>
water. [Noah] said: This day there is none that saveth from the commandment of<br>
Allah save him on whom He hath had mercy. And the wave came in between them, so<br>
he was among the drowned.<br>
44. And it was said: O earth! Swallow thy water and, O sky! be cleared of<br>
clouds! And the water was made to subside. And the commandment was fulfilled.<br>
And it [the ship] came to rest upon [the mount] Al-Judi and it was said: A far<br>
removal for wrongdoing folk!<br>
45. And Noah cried unto his Lord and said: My Lord! Lo! my son is of my<br>
household! Surely Thy promise is the truth and Thou are the Most Just of Judges.<br>
<br>
99<br>
<br>
46. He said: O Noah! Lo! he is not of thy household; lo! he is of evil conduct,<br>
so ask not of Me that whereof thou hast no knowledge. I admonish thee lest thou<br>
be among the ignorant.<br>
47. He said: My Lord! Lo! in Thee do I seek refuge [from the sin] that I should<br>
ask of Thee that whereof I have no knowledge. Unless Thou forgive me and have<br>
mercy on me I shall be among the lost.<br>
48. It was said [unto him]: O Noah! Go thou down [from the mountain] with peace<br>
from Us and blessings upon thee and some nations [that will spring] from those<br>
with thee. [There will be other] nations unto whom We shall give enjoyment a<br>
long while and then a painful doom from Us will overtake them.<br>
49. This is of the tidings of the Unseen which We inspire in thee [Muhammad].<br>
Thou thyself knewest it not, nor did thy folk [know it] before this. Then have<br>
patience. Lo! the sequel is for those who ward off [evil].<br>
50. And unto [the tribe of] A'ad [We sent] their brother, Hud. He said: O my<br>
people! Serve Allah! Ye have no other Allah save Him. Lo! ye do but invent.<br>
51. O my people! I ask of you no reward for it. Lo! my reward is the concern<br>
only of Him Who made me. Have ye then no sense?<br>
52. And, O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn unto Him<br>
repentant; He will cause the sky to rain abundance on you and will add unto you<br>
strength to your strength. Turn not away, guilty!<br>
53. They said: O Hud! Thou hast brought us no clear proof and we are not going<br>
to forsake our gods on thy [mere] saying, and we are not believers in thee.<br>
54. We say naught save that one of our gods hath possessed thee in an evil way.<br>
He said: I call Allah to witness, and do ye [too] bear witness, that I am<br>
innocent of [all] that ye ascribe as partners [to Allah]<br>
55. Beside Him. So [try to] circumvent me, all of you, give me no respite.<br>
56. Lo! I have put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Not an animal but<br>
He doth grasp it by the forelock! Lo! my Lord is on a straight path.<br>
57. And if ye turn away, still I have conveyed unto you that wherewith I was<br>
sent unto you, and my Lord will set in place of you a folk other than you. Ye<br>
cannot injure Him at all. Lo! my Lord is Guardian over all things.<br>
58. And when Our commandment came to pass We saved Hud and those who believed<br>
with him by a mercy from Us; We saved them from a harsh doom.<br>
59. And such were A'ad. They denied the revelations of their Lord and flouted<br>
His messengers and followed the command of every froward potentate.<br>
60. And a curse was made to follow them in the world and on the Day of<br>
Resurrection. Lo! A'ad disbelieved in their Lord. A far removal for A'ad, the<br>
folk of Hud!<br>
61. And unto [the tribe of] Thamud [We sent] their brother Salih. He said: O my<br>
people! Serve Allah, Ye have no other Allah save Him. He brought you forth from<br>
the earth and hath made you husband it. So ask forgiveness of Him and turn unto<br>
Him repentant. Lo! my Lord is Nigh, Responsive.<br>
62. They said: O Salih! Thou hast been among us hitherto as that wherein our<br>
hope was placed. Dost thou ask us not to worship what our fathers worshipped?<br>
Lo! we verily are in grave doubt concerning that to which thou callest us.<br>
63. He said: O my people! Bethink you: if I am [acting] on clear proof from my<br>
Lord and there hath come unto me a mercy from Him, who will save me from Allah<br>
if I disobey Him? Ye would add to me naught save perdition.<br>
100<br>
<br>
64. O my people! This is the camel of Allah, a token unto you, so suffer her to<br>
feed in Allah's earth, and touch her not with harm lest a near torment seize<br>
you.<br>
65. But they hamstrung her, and then he said: Enjoy life in your dwelling-place<br>
three days! This is a threat that will not be belied.<br>
66. So, when Our commandment came to pass, We saved Salih, and those who<br>
believed with him, by a mercy from Us, from the ignominy of that day. Lo, thy<br>
Lord! He is the Strong, the Mighty.<br>
67. And the [awful] Cry overtook those who did wrong, so that morning found them<br>
prostrate in their dwellings,<br>
68. As though they had not dwelt there. Lo! Thamud disbelieved in their Lord. A<br>
far removal for Thamud!<br>
69. And Our messengers cam unto Abraham with good news. They said: Peace! He<br>
answered: Peace! and delayed not to bring a roasted calf.<br>
70. And when he saw their hands reached not to it, he mistrusted them and<br>
conceived a fear of them. They said: Fear not! Lo! we are sent unto the folk of<br>
Lot.<br>
71. And his wife, standing by laughed when We gave her good tidings [of the<br>
birth] of Isaac, and, after Isaac, of Jacob.<br>
72. She said: Oh woe is me! Shall I bear a child when I am an old woman, and<br>
this my husband is an old man? Lo! this is a strange thing!<br>
73. They said: Wonderest thou at the commandment of Allah? The mercy of Allah<br>
and His blessings be upon you, O people of the house! Lo! He is Owner of Praise,<br>
Owner of Glory!<br>
74. And when the awe departed from Abraham, and the glad news reached him, he<br>
pleaded with Us on behalf of the folk of Lot.<br>
75. Lo! Abraham was mild, imploring, penitent.<br>
76. [It was said] O Abraham! Forsake this! Lo! thy Lord's commandment hath gone<br>
forth, and lo! there cometh unto them a doom which cannot be repelled.<br>
77. And when Our messengers came unto Lot, he was distressed and knew not how to<br>
protect them. He said: This is a distressful day.<br>
78. And his people came unto him, running towards him - and before then they<br>
used to commit abominations - He said: O my people! Here are my daughters! They<br>
are purer for you. Beware of Allah, and degrade me not in [the person of] my<br>
guests. Is there not among you any upright man?<br>
79. They said: Well thou knowest that we have no right to thy daughters, and<br>
well thou knowest what we want.<br>
80. He said: Would that I had strength to resist you or had some strong support<br>
[among you]!<br>
81. [The messengers] said: O Lot! Lo! we are messengers of thy Lord; they shall<br>
not reach thee. So travel with thy people in a part of the night, and let not<br>
one of you turn round - [all] save thy wife. Lo! that which smiteth them will<br>
smite her [also]. Lo! their tryst is [for] the morning. Is not the morning nigh?<br>
82. So when Our commandment came to pass We overthrew [that township] and rained<br>
upon it stones of clay, one after another,<br>
83. Marked with fire in the providence of thy Lord [for the destruction of the<br>
wicked]. And they are never far from the wrong-doers.<br>
101<br>
<br>
84. And unto Midian [We sent] their brother Shu'eyb. He said: O my people! Serve<br>
Allah. Ye have no other Allah save Him! And give not short measure and short<br>
weight. Lo! I see you well-to-do, and lo! I fear for you the doom of a besetting<br>
Day.<br>
85. O my people! Give full measure and full weight in justice, and wrong not<br>
people in respect of their goods. And do not evil in the earth, causing<br>
corruption.<br>
86. That which Allah leaveth with you is better for you if ye are believers; and<br>
I am not a keeper over you.<br>
87. They said: O Shu'eyb! Doth thy way of prayer command thee that we should<br>
forsake that which our fathers [used to] worship, or that we [should leave off]<br>
doing what we will with our own property. Lo! thou art the mild, the guide to<br>
right behaviour.<br>
88. He said: O my people! Bethink you: if I am [acting] on a clear proof from my<br>
Lord and He sustaineth me with fair sustenance from Him [how can I concede aught<br>
to you]? I desire not to do behind your backs that which I ask you not to do. I<br>
desire naught save reform so far as I am able. My welfare is only in Allah. In<br>
Him I trust and unto Him I turn [repentant].<br>
89. And, O my people! Let not the schism with me cause you to sin so that there<br>
befall you that which befell the folk of Noah and the folk of Hud, and the folk<br>
of Salih; and the folk of Lot are not far off from you.<br>
90. Ask pardon of your Lord and then turn unto Him [repentant]. Lo! my Lord is<br>
Merciful, Loving.<br>
91. They said: O Shu'eyb! We understand not much of that thou tellest, and lo!<br>
we do behold thee weak among us. But for thy family, we should have stoned thee,<br>
for thou art not strong against us.<br>
92. He said: O my people! Is my family more to be honoured by you than Allah?<br>
and ye put Him behind you, neglected! Lo! my Lord surroundeth what ye do.<br>
93. And, O my people! Act according to your power, lo! I [too] am acting. Ye<br>
will soon know on whom there cometh a doom that will abase him, and who it is<br>
that lieth. And watch! Lo! I am a watcher with you.<br>
94. And when Our commandment came to pass We saved Shu'eyb and those who<br>
believed with him by a mercy from Us; and the [Awful] Cry seized those who did<br>
injustice, and morning found them prostrate in their dwellings,<br>
95. As though they had not dwelt there. A far removal for Midian, even as Thamud<br>
had been removed afar!<br>
96. And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations and a clear warrant<br>
97. Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they did follow the command of Pharaoh, and<br>
the command of Pharaoh was no right guide.<br>
98. He will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection and will lead them<br>
to the Fire for watering-place. Ah, hapless is the watering-place [whither they<br>
are] led.<br>
99. A curse is made to follow them in the world and on the Day of Resurrection.<br>
Hapless is the gift [that will be] given [them].<br>
100. That is [something] of the tidings of the townships [which were destroyed<br>
of old]. We relate it unto thee [Muhammad]. Some of them are standing and some<br>
[already] reaped.<br>
<br>
102<br>
<br>
101. We wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves; and their gods on whom<br>
they call beside Allah availed them naught when came thy Lord's command; they<br>
added to them naught save ruin.<br>
102. Even thus is the grasp of thy Lord when He graspeth the townships while<br>
they are doing wrong. Lo! His grasp is painful, very strong.<br>
103. Lo! herein verily there is a portent for those who fear the doom of the<br>
Hereafter. That is a day unto which mankind will be gathered, and that is a day<br>
that will be witnessed.<br>
104. And We defer it only to a term already reckoned.<br>
105. On the day when it cometh no soul will speak except by His permission; some<br>
among them will be wretched, [others] glad.<br>
106. As for those who will be wretched [on that day] they will be in the Fire;<br>
sighing and wailing will be their portion therein,<br>
107. Abiding there so long as the heavens and the earth endure save for that<br>
which thy Lord willeth. Lo! thy Lord is Doer of what He will.<br>
108. And as for those who will be glad [that day] they will be in the Garden,<br>
abiding there so long as the heavens and the earth endure save for that which<br>
thy Lord willeth: a gift unfailing.<br>
109. So be not thou in doubt concerning that which these [folk] worship. They<br>
worship only as their fathers worshipped aforetime. Lo! we shall pay them their<br>
whole due unabated.<br>
110. And we verily gave unto Moses the Scripture, and there was strife<br>
thereupon; and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from thy<br>
Lord, the case would have been judged between them, and lo! they are in grave<br>
doubt concerning it.<br>
111. And lo! unto each thy Lord will verily repay his works in full. Lo! He is<br>
Informed of what they do.<br>
112. So tread thou the straight path as thou art commanded, and those who turn<br>
[unto Allah] with thee, and transgress not. Lo! He is Seer of what ye do.<br>
113. And incline not toward those who do wrong lest the Fire touch you, and ye<br>
have no protecting friends against Allah, and afterward ye would not be helped.<br>
114. Establish worship at the two ends of the day and in some watches of the<br>
night. Lo! good deeds annul ill-deeds. This is reminder for the mindful.<br>
115. And have patience, [O Muhammad], for lo! Allah loseth not the wages of the<br>
good.<br>
116. If only there had been among the generations before you men possessing a<br>
remnant [of good sense] to warn [their people] from corruption in the earth, as<br>
did a few of those whom We saved from them! The wrong-doers followed that by<br>
which they were made sapless, and were guilty.<br>
117. In truth thy Lord destroyed not the townships tyrannously while their folk<br>
were doing right.<br>
118. And if thy Lord had willed, He verily would have made mankind one nation,<br>
yet they cease not differing,<br>
119. Save him on whom thy Lord hath mercy; and for that He did create them. And<br>
the Word of thy Lord hath been fulfilled: Verily I shall fill hell with the jinn<br>
and mankind together.<br>
<br>
103<br>
<br>
120. And all that We relate unto thee of the story of the messengers is in order<br>
that thereby We may make firm thy heart. And herein hath come unto thee the<br>
Truth and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.<br>
121. And say unto those who believe not: Act according to your power. Lo! We<br>
[too] are acting.<br>
122. And wait! Lo! We [too] are waiting.<br>
123. And Allah's is the Invisible of the heavens and the earth, and unto Him the<br>
whole matter will be returned. So worship Him and put thy trust in Him. Lo! thy<br>
Lord is not unaware of what ye [mortals] do.<br>
<br>
SURA 12. YUSUF (JOSEPH)<br>
1. Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verse of the Scripture that maketh plain.<br>
2. Lo! We have revealed it, a Lecture in Arabic, that ye may understand.<br>
3. We narrate unto thee [Muhammad] the best of narratives in that We have<br>
inspired in thee this Qur'an, though aforetime thou wast of the heedless.<br>
4. When Joseph said unto his father: O my father! Lo! I saw in a dream eleven<br>
planets and the sun and the moon, I saw them prostrating themselves unto me.<br>
5. He said: O my dear son! Tell not thy brethren of thy vision, lest they plot a<br>
plot against thee. Lo! Satan is for man an open foe.<br>
6. Thus thy Lord will prefer thee and will teach thee the interpretation of<br>
events, and will perfect His grace upon thee and upon the family of Jacob as He<br>
perfected it upon thy forefathers, Abraham and Isaac. Lo! thy Lord is Knower,<br>
Wise.<br>
7. Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs [of Allah's Sovereignty] for the<br>
inquiring.<br>
8. When they said: Verily Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than<br>
we are, many though we be. Lo! our father is in plain aberration.<br>
9. [One said]: Kill Joseph or cast him to some [other] land, so that your<br>
father's favour may be all for you, and [that] ye may afterward be righteous<br>
folk.<br>
10. One among them said: Kill not Joseph but, if ye must be doing, fling him<br>
into the depth of the pit; some caravan will find him.<br>
11. They said: O our father! Why wilt thou not trust us with Joseph, when lo! we<br>
are good friends to him?<br>
12. Send him with us to-morrow that he may enjoy himself and play. And lo! we<br>
shall take good care of him.<br>
13. He said: Lo! in truth it saddens me that ye should take him with you, and I<br>
fear less the wolf devour him while ye are heedless of him.<br>
14. They said: If the wolf should devour him when we are [so strong] a band,<br>
then surely we should have already perished.<br>
15. Then, when they led him off, and were of one mind that they should place him<br>
in the depth of the pit, We inspired in him: Thou wilt tell them of this deed of<br>
theirs when they know [thee] not.<br>
16. And they came weeping to their father in the evening.<br>
<br>
104<br>
<br>
17. Saying: O our father! We went racing one with another, and left Joseph by<br>
our things, and the wolf devoured him, and thou believest not our saying even<br>
when we speak the truth.<br>
18. And they came with false blood on his shirt. He said: Nay, but your minds<br>
have beguiled you into something. [My course is] comely patience. And Allah it<br>
is Whose help is to be sought in that [predicament] which ye describe.<br>
19. And there came a caravan, and they sent their waterdrawer. He let down his<br>
pail [into the pit]. He said: Good luck! Here is a youth. And they hid him as a<br>
treasure, and Allah was Aware of what they did.<br>
20. And they sold him for a low price, a number of silver coins; and they<br>
attached no value to him.<br>
21. And he of Egypt who purchased him said unto his wife: Receive him<br>
honourably. Perchance he may prove useful to us or we may adopt him as a son.<br>
Thus we established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the<br>
interpretation of events. And Allah was predominant in His career, but most of<br>
mankind know not.<br>
22. And And when he reached his prime We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus We<br>
reward the good.<br>
23. And she, in whose house he was, asked of him an evil act. She bolted the<br>
doors and said: Come! He said: I seek refuge in Allah! Lo! he is my lord, who<br>
hath treated me honourably. Lo! wrong-doers never prosper.<br>
24. She verily desired him, and he would have desired her if it had not been<br>
that he saw the argument of his Lord. Thus it was, that We might ward off from<br>
him evil and lewdness. Lo! he was of Our chosen slaves.<br>
25. And they raced with one another to the door, and she tore his shirt from<br>
behind, and they met her lord and master at the door. She said: What shall be<br>
his reward, who wisheth evil to thy folk, save prison or a painful doom?<br>
26. [Joseph] said: She it was who asked of me an evil act. And a witness of her<br>
own folk testified: If his shirt is torn from before, then she speaketh truth<br>
and he is of the liars.<br>
27. And if his shirt is torn from behind, then she hath lied and he is of the<br>
truthful.<br>
28. So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said: Lo! this is of the guile<br>
of you women. Lo! the guile of you is very great.<br>
29. O Joseph! Turn away from this, and thou, [O woman], ask forgiveness for thy<br>
sin. Lo! thou art of the faulty.<br>
30. And women in the city said: The ruler's wife is asking of her slave-boy an<br>
ill-deed. Indeed he has smitten her to the heart with love. We behold her in<br>
plain aberration.<br>
31. And when she heard of their sly talk, she sent to them and prepared for them<br>
a cushioned couch [to lie on at the feast] and gave to every one of them a knife<br>
and said [to Joseph]: Come out unto them! And when they saw him they exalted him<br>
and cut their hands, exclaiming: Allah Blameless! This is no a human being. This<br>
is not other than some gracious angel.<br>
32. She said: This is he on whose account ye blamed me. I asked of him an evil<br>
act, but he proved continent, but if he do not my behest he verily shall be<br>
imprisoned, and verily shall be of those brought low.<br>
<br>
105<br>
<br>
33. He said: O my Lord! Prison is more dear than that unto which they urge me,<br>
and if Thou fend not off their wiles from me I shall incline unto them and<br>
become of the foolish.<br>
34. So his Lord heard his prayer and fended off their wiles from him. Lo! He is<br>
Hearer, Knower.<br>
35. And it seemed good to them [the men-folk] after they had seen the signs [of<br>
his innocence] to imprison him for a time.<br>
36. And two young men went to prison with him. One of them said: I dreamed that<br>
I was pressing wine. The other said: I dreamed that I was carrying upon my head<br>
bread whereof the birds were eating. Announce unto us the interpretation, for we<br>
see thee of those good [at interpretation].<br>
37. He said: The food which ye are given [daily] shall not come unto you but I<br>
shall tell you the interpretation ere it cometh unto you. This is of that which<br>
my Lord hath taught me. Lo! I have forsaken the religion of folk who believe not<br>
in Allah and are disbelievers in the Hereafter.<br>
38. And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.<br>
It never was for us to attribute aught as partner to Allah. This is of the<br>
bounty of Allah unto us [the seed of Abraham] and unto mankind; but most men<br>
give not thanks.<br>
39. O my fellow-prisoners! Are divers lords better, or Allah the One, Almighty?<br>
40. Those whom ye worship beside Him are but names which ye have named, ye and<br>
your fathers. Allah hath revealed no sanction for them. The decision rests with<br>
Allah only, Who hath commanded you that ye worship none save Him. This is the<br>
right religion, but most men know not.<br>
41. O my two fellow-prisoners! As for one of you, he will pour out wine for his<br>
lord to drink; and as for the other, he will be crucified so that the birds will<br>
eat from his head. Thus is the case judged concerning which ye did inquire.<br>
42. And he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released: Mention me<br>
in the presence of thy lord. But Satan caused him to forget to mention it to his<br>
lord, so he [Joseph] stayed in prison for some years.<br>
43. And the king said: Lo! I saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean were<br>
eating, and seven green ears of corn and other [seven] dry. O notables! Expound<br>
for me my vision, if ye can interpret dreams.<br>
44. They answered: Jumbled dreams! And we are not knowing in the interpretation<br>
of dreams.<br>
45. And he of the two who was released, and [now] at length remembered, said: I<br>
am going to announce unto you the interpretation, therefore send me forth.<br>
46. [And when he came to Joseph in the prison, he exclaimed]: Joseph! O thou<br>
truthful one! Expound for us the seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and<br>
the seven green ears of corn and other [seven] dry, that I may return unto the<br>
people, so that they may know.<br>
47. He said: Ye shall sow seven years as usual, but that which ye reap, leave it<br>
in the ear, all save a little which ye eat.<br>
48. Then after that will come seven hard years which will devour all that ye<br>
have prepared for them, save a little of that which ye have stored.<br>
49. Then, after that, will come a year when the people will have plenteous crops<br>
and when they will press [wine and oil].<br>
<br>
106<br>
<br>
50. And the king said: Bring him unto me. And when the messenger came unto him,<br>
he [Joseph] said: Return unto thy lord and ask him what was the case of the<br>
women who cut their hands. Lo! my Lord knoweth their guile.<br>
51. He [the king] [then sent for those women and] said: What happened when ye<br>
asked an evil act of Joseph? They answered: Allah Blameless! We know no evil of<br>
him. Said the wife of the ruler: Now the truth is out. I asked of him an evil<br>
act, and he is surely of the truthful.<br>
52. [Then Joseph said: I asked for] this, that he [my lord] may know that I<br>
betrayed him not in secret, and that surely Allah guideth not the snare of the<br>
betrayers.<br>
53. I do not exculpate myself. Lo! the [human] soul enjoineth unto evil, save<br>
that whereon my Lord hath mercy. Lo! my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
54. And the king said: Bring him unto me that I may attach him to my person. And<br>
when he had talked with him he said: Lo! thou art to-day in our presence<br>
established and trusted.<br>
55. He said: Set me over the storehouses of the land. Lo! I am a skilled<br>
custodian.<br>
56. Thus gave We power to Joseph in the land. He was the owner of it where he<br>
pleased. We reach with Our mercy whom We will. We lose not the reward of the<br>
good.<br>
57. And the reward of the Hereafter is better, for those who believe and ward<br>
off [evil].<br>
58. And Joseph's brethren came and presented themselves before him, and he knew<br>
them but they knew him not.<br>
59. And when he provided them with their provision he said: Bring unto me a<br>
brother of yours from your father. See ye not that I fill up the measure and I<br>
am the best of hosts?<br>
60. And if ye bring him not unto me, then there shall be no measure for you with<br>
me, nor shall ye draw near.<br>
61. They said: We will try to win him from his father: that we will surely do.<br>
62. He said unto his young men: Place their merchandise in their saddlebags, so<br>
that they may know it when they go back to their folk, and so will come again.<br>
63. So when they went back to their father they said: O our father! The measure<br>
is denied us, so send with us our brother that we may obtain the measure, surely<br>
we will guard him well.<br>
64. He said: Can I entrust him to you save as I entrusted his brother to you<br>
aforetime? Allah is better at guarding, and He is the Most Merciful of those who<br>
show mercy.<br>
65. And when they opened their belongings they discovered that their merchandise<br>
had been returned to them. They said: O our father! What [more] can we ask? Here<br>
is our merchandise returned to us. We shall get provision for our folk and guard<br>
our brother, and we shall have the extra measure of a camel [load]. This [that<br>
we bring now] is a light measure.<br>
66. He said: I will not send him with you till ye give me an undertaking in the<br>
name of Allah that ye will bring him back to me, unless ye are surrounded. And<br>
when they gave him their undertaking he said: Allah is the Warden over what we<br>
say.<br>
<br>
107<br>
<br>
67. And he said: O my sons! Go not in by one gate; go in by different gates. I<br>
can naught avail you as against Allah. Lo! the decision rests with Allah only.<br>
In Him do I put my trust, and in Him let all the trusting put their trust.<br>
68. And when they entered in the manner which their father had enjoined, it<br>
would have naught availed them as against Allah; it was but a need of Jacob's<br>
soul which he thus satisfied; and lo! he was a lord of knowledge because We had<br>
taught him; but most of mankind know not.<br>
69. And when they went in before Joseph, he took his brother unto him, saying:<br>
Lo! I, even I, am thy brother, therefore sorrow not for what they did.<br>
70. And when he provided them with their provision, he put the drinking-cup in<br>
his brother's saddlebag, and then a crier cried: O camel-riders! Lo! ye are<br>
surely thieves!<br>
71. They cried, coming toward them: What is it ye have lost?<br>
72. They said: We have lost the king's cup, and he who bringeth it shall have a<br>
camel-load, and I [said Joseph] am answerable for it.<br>
73. They said: By Allah, well ye know we came not to do evil in the land, and<br>
are no thieves.<br>
74. They said: And what shall be the penalty for it, if ye prove liars?<br>
75. They said: The penalty for it! He in whose bag [the cup] is found, he is the<br>
penalty for it. Thus we requite wrong-doers.<br>
76. Then he [Joseph] began the search with their bags before his brother's bag,<br>
then he produced it from his brother's bag. Thus did We contrive for Joseph. He<br>
could not have taken his brother according to the king's law unless Allah<br>
willed. We raise by grades [of mercy] whom We will, and over every lord of<br>
knowledge there is one more knowing.<br>
77. They said: If he stealeth, a brother of his stole before. But Joseph kept it<br>
secret in his soul and revealed it not unto them. He said [within himself]: Ye<br>
are in worse case, and Allah knoweth best [the truth of] that which ye allege.<br>
78. They said: O ruler of the land! Lo! he hath a very aged father, so take one<br>
of us instead of him. Lo! we behold thee of those who do kindness.<br>
79. He said: Allah forbid that we should seize save him with whom we found our<br>
property; then truly we should be wrong-doers.<br>
80. So, When they despaired of [moving] him, they conferred together apart. The<br>
eldest of them said: Know ye not how your father took an undertaking from you in<br>
Allah's name and how ye failed in the case of Joseph aforetime? Therefore I<br>
shall not go forth from the land until my father giveth leave or Allah judgeth<br>
for me. He is the Best of Judges.<br>
81. Return unto your father and say: O our father! Lo! thy son hath stolen. We<br>
testify only to that which we know; we are not guardians of the Unseen.<br>
82. Ask the township where we were, and the caravan with which we travelled<br>
hither. Lo! we speak the truth.<br>
83. [And when they came unto their father and had spoken thus to him] he said:<br>
Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something. [My course is] comely<br>
patience! It may be that Allah will bring them all unto me. Lo! He, only He, is<br>
the Knower, the Wise.<br>
84. And he turned away from them and said: Alas, my grief for Joseph! And his<br>
eyes were whitened with the sorrow that he was suppressing.<br>
<br>
108<br>
<br>
85. They said: By Allah, thou wilt never cease remembering Joseph till thy<br>
health is ruined or thou art of those who perish!<br>
86. He said: I expose my distress and anguish only unto Allah, and I know from<br>
Allah that which ye know not.<br>
87. Go, O my sons, and ascertain concerning Joseph and his brother, and despair<br>
not of the Spirit of Allah. Lo! none despaireth of the Spirit of Allah save<br>
disbelieving folk.<br>
88. And when they came [again] before him [Joseph] they said: O ruler!<br>
Misfortune hath touched us and our folk, and we bring but poor merchandise, so<br>
fill for us the measure and be charitable unto us. Lo! Allah will requite the<br>
charitable,<br>
89. He said: Know ye what ye did unto Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?<br>
90. They said: Is it indeed thou who art Joseph? He said: I am Joseph and this<br>
is my brother. Allah hath shown us favour. Lo! he who wardeth off [evil] and<br>
endureth [findeth favour]; for lo! Allah loseth not the wages of the kindly.<br>
91. They said: By Allah, verily Allah hath preferred thee above us, and we were<br>
indeed sinful.<br>
92. He said: Have no fear this day! May Allah forgive you, and He is the Most<br>
Merciful of those who show mercy.<br>
93. Go with this shirt of mine and lay it on my father's face, he will become<br>
[again] a seer; and come to me with all your folk.<br>
94. When the caravan departed their father had said: Truly I am conscious of the<br>
breath of Joseph, though ye call me dotard.<br>
95. [Those around him] said: By Allah, lo! thou art in thine old aberration.<br>
96. Then, when the bearer of glad tidings came, he laid it on his face and he<br>
became a seer once more. He said: Said I not unto you that I know from Allah<br>
that which ye know not?<br>
97. They said: O our father! Ask forgiveness of our sins for us, for lo! we were<br>
sinful.<br>
98. He said: I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Lo! He is the<br>
Forgiving, the Merciful.<br>
99. And when they came in before Joseph, he took his parents unto him, and said:<br>
Come into Egypt safe, if Allah will!<br>
100. And he placed his parents on the dais and they fell down before him<br>
prostrate, and he said: O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream of<br>
old. My Lord hath made it true, and He hath shown me kindness, since He took me<br>
out of the prison and hath brought you from the desert after Satan had made<br>
strife between me and my brethren. Lo! my Lord is tender unto whom He will. He<br>
is the Knower, the Wise.<br>
101. O my Lord! Thou hast given me [something] of sovereignty and hast taught me<br>
[something] of the interpretation of events - Creator of the heavens and the<br>
earth! Thou art my Protecting Guardian in the world and the Hereafter. Make me<br>
to die muslim [unto Thee], and join me to the righteous.<br>
102. This is of the tidings of the Unseen which We inspire in thee [Muhammad].<br>
Thou wast not present with them when they fixed their plan and they were<br>
scheming.<br>
103. And though thou try much, most men will not believe.<br>
<br>
109<br>
<br>
104. Thou askest them no fee for it. It is naught else than a reminder unto the<br>
peoples.<br>
105. How many a portent is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by<br>
with face averted!<br>
106. And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners<br>
[unto Him].<br>
107. Deem they themselves secure from the coming on them of a pall of Allah's<br>
punishment, or the coming of the Hour suddenly while they are unaware?<br>
108. Say: This is my Way: I call on Allah with sure knowledge. I and whosoever<br>
followeth me - Glory be to Allah! - and I am not of the idolaters.<br>
109. We sent not before thee [any<br>
among the folk of the townships the nature of the consequence for<br>
abode of the Hereafter, for those<br>
sense? -<br>
<br>
messengers] save men whom We inspired from<br>
Have they not travelled in the land and seen<br>
those who were before them? And verily the<br>
who ward off [evil], is best. Have ye then no<br>
<br>
110. Till, when the messengers despaired and thought that they were denied, then<br>
came unto them Our help, and whom We would was saved. And Our wrath cannot be<br>
warded from the guilty.<br>
111. In their history verily there is a lesson for men of understanding. It is<br>
no invented story but a confirmation of the existing [Scripture] and a detailed<br>
explanation of everything, and a guidance and a mercy for folk who believe.<br>
<br>
SURA 13. AR-RAD (THE THUNDER)<br>
1. Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture. That which is revealed<br>
unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth, but most of mankind believe not.<br>
2. Allah it is Who raised up the heavens without visible supports, then mounted<br>
the Throne, and compelled the sun and the moon to be of service, each runneth<br>
unto an appointed term; He ordereth the course; He detaileth the revelations,<br>
that haply ye may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.<br>
3. And He it is Who spread out the earth and placed therein firm hills and<br>
flowing streams, and of all fruits He placed therein two spouses [male and<br>
female]. He covereth the night with the day. Lo! herein verily are portents for<br>
people who take thought.<br>
4. And in the Earth are neighbouring tracts, vineyards and ploughed lands, and<br>
date-palms, like and unlike, which are watered with one water. And we have made<br>
some of them to excel others in fruit. Lo! herein verily are portents for people<br>
who have sense.<br>
5. And if thou wonderest, then wondrous is their saying: When we are dust, are<br>
we then forsooth [to be raised] in a new creation? Such are they who disbelieve<br>
in their Lord; such have carcans on their necks; such are rightful owners of the<br>
Fire, they will abide therein.<br>
6. And they bid thee hasten on the evil rather than the good, when exemplary<br>
punishments have indeed occurred before them. But lo! thy Lord is rich in pardon<br>
for mankind despite their wrong, and lo! thy Lord is strong in punishment.<br>
7. Those who disbelieve say: If only some portent were sent down upon him from<br>
his Lord! Thou art a warner only, and for every folk a guide.<br>
<br>
110<br>
<br>
8. Allah knoweth that which every female beareth and that which the wombs absorb<br>
and that which they grow. And everything with Him is measured.<br>
9. He is the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, the Great, the High<br>
Exalted.<br>
10. Alike of you is he who hideth the saying and he who noiseth it abroad, he<br>
who lurketh in the night and he who goeth freely in the daytime.<br>
11. For him are angels ranged before him and behind him, who guard him by<br>
Allah's command. Lo! Allah changeth not the condition of a folk until they<br>
[first] change that which is in their hearts; and if Allah willeth misfortune<br>
for a folk there is none that can repel it, nor have they a defender beside Him.<br>
12. He it is Who showeth you the lightning, a fear and a hope, and raiseth the<br>
heavy clouds.<br>
13. The thunder hymneth His praise and [so do] the angels for awe of Him. He<br>
launcheth the thunderbolts and smiteth with them whom He will while they dispute<br>
[in doubt] concerning Allah, and He is mighty in wrath.<br>
14. Unto Him is the real prayer. Those unto whom they pray beside Allah respond<br>
to them not at all, save as [is the response to] one who stretcheth forth his<br>
hands toward water [asking] that it may come unto his mouth, and it will never<br>
reach it. The prayer of disbelievers goeth [far] astray.<br>
15. And unto Allah falleth prostrate whosoever is in the heavens and the earth,<br>
willingly or unwillingly, as do their shadows in the morning and the evening<br>
hours.<br>
16. Say [O Muhammad]: Who is Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: Allah. Say:<br>
Take ye then [others] beside Him for protectors, which, even for themselves,<br>
have neither benefit nor hurt? Say: Is the blind man equal to the seer, or is<br>
darkness equal to light? Or assign they unto Allah partners who created the like<br>
of His creation so that the creation [which they made and His creation] seemed<br>
alike to them? Say: Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the<br>
Almighty.<br>
17. He sendeth down water from the sky, so that valleys flow according to their<br>
measure, and the flood beareth [on its surface] swelling foam - from that which<br>
they smelt in the fire in order to make ornaments and tools riseth a foam like<br>
unto it - thus Allah coineth [the similitude of] the true and the false. Then,<br>
as for the foam, it passeth away as scum upon the banks, while, as for that<br>
which is of use to mankind, it remaineth in the earth. Thus Allah coineth the<br>
similitudes.<br>
18. For those who answered Allah's call is bliss; and for those who answered not<br>
His call, if they had all that is in the earth, and therewith the like thereof,<br>
they would proffer it as ransom. Such will have a woeful reckoning, and their<br>
habitation will be hell, a dire abode.<br>
19. Is he who knoweth that what is revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the truth<br>
like him who is blind? But only men of understanding heed;<br>
20. Such as keep the pact of Allah, and break not the covenant;<br>
21. Such as unite that which Allah hath commandeth should be joined, and fear<br>
their Lord, and dread a woeful reckoning;<br>
22. Such as persevere in seeking their Lord's Countenance and are regular in<br>
prayer and spend of that which We bestow upon them secretly and openly, and<br>
overcome evil with good. Theirs will be the sequel of the [heavenly] Home,<br>
<br>
111<br>
<br>
23. Gardens of Eden which they enter, along with all who do right of their<br>
fathers and their helpmeets and their seed. The angels enter unto them from<br>
every gate,<br>
24. [Saying]: Peace be unto you because ye persevered. Ah, passing sweet will be<br>
the sequel of the [heavenly] Home.<br>
25. And those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever that<br>
which Allah hath commanded should be joined, and make mischief in the earth:<br>
theirs is the curse and theirs the ill abode.<br>
26. Allah enlargeth livelihood for whom He will, and straiteneth [it for whom He<br>
will]; and they rejoice in the life of the world, whereas the life of the world<br>
is but brief comfort as compared with the Hereafter.<br>
27. Those who disbelieve say: If only a portent were sent down upon him from his<br>
Lord! Say: Lo! Allah sendeth whom He will astray, and guideth unto Himself all<br>
who turn [unto Him],<br>
28. Who have believed and whose hearts have rest in the remembrance of Allah.<br>
Verily in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest!<br>
29. Those who believe and do right: Joy is for them, and bliss [their] journey's<br>
end.<br>
30. Thus We send thee [O Muhammad] unto a nation, before whom other nations have<br>
passed away, that thou mayst recite unto them that which We have inspired in<br>
thee, while they are disbelievers in the Beneficent. Say: He is my Lord; there<br>
is no Allah save Him. In Him do I put my trust and unto Him is my recourse.<br>
31. Had it been possible for a Lecture to cause the mountains to move, or the<br>
earth to be torn asunder, or the dead to speak, [this Qur'an would have done<br>
so]. Nay, but Allah's is the whole command. Do not those who believe know that,<br>
had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind? As for those who disbelieve,<br>
disaster ceaseth not to strike them because of what they do, or it dwelleth near<br>
their home until the threat of Allah come to pass. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep<br>
the tryst.<br>
32. And verily messengers [of Allah] were mocked before thee, but long I bore<br>
with those who disbelieved. At length I seized them, and how [awful] was My<br>
punishment!<br>
33. Is He Who is aware of the deserts of every soul [as he who is aware of<br>
nothing]? Yet they ascribe unto Allah partners. Say: Name them. Is it that ye<br>
would inform Him of something which He knoweth not in the earth? Or is it but a<br>
way of speaking? Nay but their contrivance is made seeming fair for those who<br>
disbelieve and they are kept from the right road. He whom Allah sendeth astray,<br>
for him there is no guide.<br>
34. For them is torment in the life of the world, and verily the doom of the<br>
Hereafter is more painful, and they have no defender from Allah.<br>
35. A similitude of the Garden which is promised unto those who keep their duty<br>
[to Allah]: Underneath it rivers flow; its food is everlasting, and its shade;<br>
this is the reward of those who keep their duty, while the reward of<br>
disbelievers is the Fire.<br>
36. Those unto whom We gave the Scripture rejoice in that which is revealed unto<br>
thee. And of the clans there are who deny some of it. Say: I am commanded only<br>
that I serve Allah and ascribe unto Him no partner. Unto Him I cry, and unto Him<br>
is my return.<br>
<br>
112<br>
<br>
37. Thus have We revealed it, a decisive utterance in Arabic; and if thou<br>
shouldst follow their desires after that which hath come unto thee of knowledge,<br>
then truly wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting friend nor defender.<br>
38. And verily We sent messengers [to mankind] before thee, and We appointed for<br>
them wives and offspring, and it was not [given] to any messenger that he should<br>
bring a portent save by Allah's leave. For everything there is a time<br>
prescribed.<br>
39. Allah effaceth what He will, and establisheth [what He will], and with Him<br>
is the source of ordinance.<br>
40. Whether We let thee see something of that which We have promised them, or<br>
make thee die [before its happening], thine is but conveyance [of the message].<br>
Ours the reckoning.<br>
41. See they not how we aim to the land, reducing it of its outlying parts?<br>
[When] Allah doometh there is none that can postpone His doom, and He is swift<br>
at reckoning.<br>
42. Those who were before them plotted; but all plotting is Allah's. He knoweth<br>
that which each soul earneth. The disbelievers will come to know for whom will<br>
be the sequel of the [heavenly] Home.<br>
43. They who disbelieve say: Thou art no messenger [of Allah]. Say: Allah, and<br>
whosoever hath knowledge of the Scripture, is sufficient witness between me and<br>
you.<br>
<br>
SURA 14. IBRAHIM (ABRAHAM)<br>
1. Alif. Lam. Ra. [This is] a Scripture which We have revealed unto thee<br>
[Muhammad] that thereby thou mayst bring forth mankind from darkness unto light,<br>
by the permission of their Lord, unto the path of the Mighty, the Owner of<br>
Praise,<br>
2. Allah, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in<br>
the earth. and woe unto the disbelievers from an awful doom;<br>
3. Those who love the life of the world more than the Hereafter, and debar [men]<br>
from the way of Allah and would have it crooked: such are far astray.<br>
4. And We never sent a messenger save with the language of his folk, that he<br>
might make [the message] clear for them. Then Allah sendeth whom He will astray,<br>
and guideth whom He will. He is the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
5. We verily sent Moses with Our revelations, saying: Bring thy people forth<br>
from darkness unto light. And remind them of the days of Allah. Lo! therein are<br>
revelations for each steadfast, thankful [heart].<br>
6. And [remind them] how Moses said unto his people: Remember Allah's favour<br>
unto you when He delivered you from Pharaoh's folk who were afflicting you with<br>
dreadful torment, and were slaying your sons and sparing your women; that was a<br>
tremendous trial from your Lord.<br>
7. And when your Lord proclaimed: If ye give thanks, I will give you more; but<br>
if ye are thankless, lo! My punishment is dire.<br>
8. And Moses said: Though ye and all who are in the earth prove thankless, lo!<br>
Allah verily is Absolute, Owner of Praise.<br>
9. Hath not the history of those before you reached you: the folk of Noah, and<br>
[the tribes of] A'ad and Thamud, and those after them? None save Allah knoweth<br>
<br>
113<br>
<br>
them. Their messengers came unto them with clear proofs, but they thrust their<br>
hands into their mouths, and said: Lo! we disbelieve in that wherewith ye have<br>
been sent, and lo! we are in grave doubt concerning that to which ye call us.<br>
10. Their messengers said: Can there be doubt concerning Allah, the Creator of<br>
the heavens and the earth? He calleth you that He may forgive you your sins and<br>
reprieve you unto an appointed term. They said: Ye are but mortals like us, who<br>
would fain turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring some<br>
clear warrant.<br>
11. Their messengers said unto them: We are but mortals like you, but Allah<br>
giveth grace unto whom He will of His slaves. It is not ours to bring you a<br>
warrant unless by the permission of Allah. In Allah let believers put their<br>
trust!<br>
12. How should we not put our trust in Allah when He hath shown us our ways? We<br>
surely will endure the hurt ye do us. In Allah let the trusting put their trust.<br>
13. And those who disbelieved said unto their messengers: Verily we will drive<br>
you out from our land, unless ye return to our religion. Then their Lord<br>
inspired them, [saying]: Verily we shall destroy the wrong-doers,<br>
14. And verily We shall make you to dwell in the land after them. This is for<br>
him who feareth My Majesty and feareth My threats.<br>
15. And they sought help [from their Lord] and every froward potentate was<br>
bought to naught;<br>
16. Hell is before him, and he is made to drink a festering water,<br>
17. Which he sippeth but can hardly swallow, and death cometh unto him from<br>
every side while yet he cannot die, and before him is a harsh doom.<br>
18. A similitude of those who disbelieve in their Lord: Their works are as ashes<br>
which the wind bloweth hard upon a stormy day. They have no control of aught<br>
that they have earned. That is the extreme failure.<br>
19. Hast thou not seen that Allah hath created the heavens and the earth with<br>
truth? If He will, He can remove you and bring [in] some new creation;<br>
20. And that is no great matter for Allah.<br>
21. They all come forth unto their Lord. Then those who were despised say unto<br>
those who were scornful: We were unto you a following, can ye then avert from us<br>
aught of Allah's doom? They say: Had Allah guided us, we should have guided you.<br>
Whether we rage or patiently endure is [now] all one for us; we have no place of<br>
refuge.<br>
22. And Satan saith, when the matter hath been decided: Lo! Allah promised you a<br>
promise of truth; and I promised you, then failed you. And I had no power over<br>
you save that I called unto you and ye obeyed me. So blame not, but blame<br>
yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can ye help me, Lo! I disbelieved in that<br>
which ye before ascribed to me. Lo! for wrong-doers is a painful doom.<br>
23. And those who believed and did good works are made to enter Gardens<br>
underneath which rivers flow, therein abiding by permission of their Lord, their<br>
greeting therein: Peace!<br>
24. Seest thou not how Allah coineth a similitude: A goodly saying, as a goodly<br>
tree, its root set firm, its branches reaching into heaven,<br>
25. Giving its fruit at every season by permission of its Lord? Allah coineth<br>
the similitudes for mankind in order that they may reflect.<br>
<br>
114<br>
<br>
26. And the similitude of a bad saying is as a bad tree, uprooted from upon the<br>
earth, possessing no stability.<br>
27. Allah confirmeth those who believe by a firm saying in the life of the world<br>
and in the Hereafter, and Allah sendeth wrong-doers astray. And Allah doeth what<br>
He will.<br>
28. Hast thou not seen those who gave the grace of Allah in exchange for<br>
thanklessness and led their people down to the Abode of Loss,<br>
29. [Even to] hell? They are exposed thereto. A hapless end!<br>
30. And they set up rivals to Allah that they may mislead [men] from His way.<br>
Say: Enjoy life [while ye may] for lo! your journey's end will be the Fire.<br>
31. Tell My bondmen who believe to establish worship and spend of that which We<br>
have given them, secretly and publicly, before a day cometh wherein there will<br>
be neither traffick nor befriending.<br>
32. Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth, and causeth water to<br>
descend from the sky, thereby producing fruits as food for you, and maketh the<br>
ships to be of service unto you, that they may run upon the sea at His command,<br>
and hath made of service unto you the rivers;<br>
33. And maketh the sun and the moon, constant in their courses, to be of service<br>
unto you, and hath made of service unto you the night and the day.<br>
34. And He giveth you of all ye ask of Him, and if ye would count the bounty of<br>
Allah ye cannot reckon it. Lo! man is verily a wrong-doer, an ingrate.<br>
35. And when Abraham said: My Lord! Make safe this territory, and preserve me<br>
and my sons from serving idols.<br>
36. My Lord! Lo! they have led many of mankind astray. But whoso followeth me,<br>
he verily is of me. And whoso disobeyeth me - Still Thou art Forgiving,<br>
Merciful.<br>
37. Our Lord! Lo! I have settled some of my posterity in an uncultivable valley<br>
near unto Thy holy House, our Lord! that they may establish proper worship; so<br>
incline some hearts of men that they may yearn toward them, and provide Thou<br>
them with fruits in order that they may be thankful.<br>
38. Our Lord! Lo! Thou knowest that which we hide and that which we proclaim.<br>
Nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allah.<br>
39. Praise be to Allah Who hath given me, in my old age, Ishmael and Isaac! Lo!<br>
my Lord is indeed the Hearer of Prayer.<br>
40. My Lord! Make me to establish proper worship, and some of my posterity<br>
[also]; our Lord! and accept my prayer.<br>
41. Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents and believers on the day when the<br>
account is cast.<br>
42. Deem not that Allah is unaware of what the wicked do. He but giveth them a<br>
respite till a day when eyes will stare [in terror],<br>
43. As they come hurrying on in fear, their heads upraised, their gaze returning<br>
not to them, and their hearts as air.<br>
44. And warn mankind of a day when the doom will come upon them, and those who<br>
did wrong will say: Our Lord! Reprieve us for a little while. We will obey Thy<br>
call and will follow the messengers. [It will be answered]: Did ye not swear<br>
before that there would be no end for you?<br>
<br>
115<br>
<br>
45. And [have ye not] dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves [of<br>
old] and [hath it not] become plain to you how We dealt with them and made<br>
examples for you?<br>
46. Verily they have plotted their plot, and their plot is with Allah, though<br>
their plot were one whereby the mountains should be moved.<br>
47. So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His messengers. Lo!<br>
Allah is Mighty, Able to Requite [the wrong].<br>
48. On the day when the earth will be changed to other than the earth, and the<br>
heavens [also will be changed] and they will come forth unto Allah, the One, the<br>
Almighty,<br>
49. Thou wilt see the guilty on that day linked together in chains,<br>
50. Their raiment of pitch, and the Fire covering their faces,<br>
51. That Allah may repay each soul what it hath earned. Lo! Allah is swift at<br>
reckoning.<br>
52. This is a clear message for mankind in order that they may be warned<br>
thereby, and that they may know that He is only One Allah, and that men of<br>
understanding may take heed.<br>
<br>
SURA 15. AL-HIJR (AL-HIJR, STONELAND, ROCK CITY)<br>
1. Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture and a plain Reading.<br>
2. It may be that those who disbelieve wish ardently that they were Muslims.<br>
3. Let them eat and enjoy life, and let [false] hope beguile them. They will<br>
come to know!<br>
4. And We destroyed no township but there was a known decree for it.<br>
5. No nation can outstrip its term nor can they lag behind.<br>
6. And they say: O thou unto whom the Reminder is revealed, lo! thou art indeed<br>
a madman!<br>
7. Why bringest thou not angels unto us, if thou art of the truthful?<br>
8. We send not down the angels save with the Fact, and in that case [the<br>
disbelievers] would not be tolerated.<br>
9. Lo! We, even We, reveal the Reminder, and lo! We verily are its Guardian.<br>
10. We verily sent [messengers] before thee among the factions of the men of<br>
old.<br>
11. And never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him.<br>
12. Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty:<br>
13. They believe not therein, though the example of the men of old hath gone<br>
before.<br>
14. And even if We opened unto them a gate of heaven and they kept mounting<br>
through it,<br>
15. They would say: Our sight is wrong - nay, but we are folk bewitched.<br>
16. And verily in the heaven we have set mansions of the stars, and We have<br>
beautified it for beholders.<br>
17. And We have guarded it from every outcast devil,<br>
116<br>
<br>
18. Save him who stealeth the hearing, and them doth a clear flame pursue.<br>
19. And the earth have We spread out, and placed therein firm hills, and caused<br>
each seemly thing to grow therein.<br>
20. And we have given unto you livelihoods therein, and unto those for whom ye<br>
provide not.<br>
21. And there is not a thing but with Us are the stores thereof. And we send it<br>
not down save in appointed measure.<br>
22. And We send the winds fertilising, and cause water to descend from the sky,<br>
and give it you to drink. It is not ye who are the holders of the store thereof.<br>
23. Lo! and it is We, even We, Who quicken and give death, and We are the<br>
Inheritor.<br>
24. And verily We know the eager among you and verily We know the laggards.<br>
25. Lo! thy Lord will gather them together. Lo! He is Wise, Aware.<br>
26. Doesn't really matter what he created man of.<br>
27. And the jinn did We create aforetime of essential fire.<br>
28. And [remember] when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am creating a<br>
mortal out of potter's clay of black mud altered,<br>
29. So, when I have made him and have breathed into him of My Spirit, do ye fall<br>
down, prostrating yourselves unto him.<br>
30. So the angels fell prostrate, all of them together<br>
31. Save Iblis. He refused to be among the prostrate.<br>
32. He said: O Iblis! What aileth thee that thou art not among the prostrate?<br>
33. He said: I am not one to prostrate myself unto a mortal whom Thou hast<br>
created out of potter's clay of black mud altered!<br>
34. He said: Then go thou forth from hence, for lo! thou art outcast.<br>
35. And lo! the curse shall be upon thee till the Day of Judgment.<br>
36. He said: My Lord! Reprieve me till the day when they are raised.<br>
37. He said: Then lo! thou art of those reprieved<br>
38. Till the Day of appointed time.<br>
39. He said: My Lord! Because Thou hast sent me astray, I verily shall adorn the<br>
path of error for them in the earth, and shall mislead them every one,<br>
40. Save such of them as are Thy perfectly devoted slaves.<br>
41. He said: This is a right course incumbent upon Me:<br>
42. Lo! as for My slaves, thou hast no power over any of them save such of the<br>
froward as follow thee,<br>
43. And lo! for all such, hell will be the promised place.<br>
44. It hath seven gates, and each gate hath an appointed portion.<br>
45. Lo! those who ward off [evil] are among gardens and watersprings.<br>
46. [And it is said unto them]: Enter them in peace, secure.<br>
47. And We remove whatever rancour may be in their breasts. As brethren, face to<br>
face, [they rest] on couches raised.<br>
<br>
117<br>
<br>
48. Toil cometh not unto them there, nor will they be expelled from thence.<br>
49. Announce, [O Muhammad] unto My slaves that verily I am the Forgiving, the<br>
Merciful,<br>
50. And that My doom is the dolorous doom.<br>
51. And tell them of Abraham's guests,<br>
52. [How] when they came in unto him, and said: Peace. He said: Lo! we are<br>
afraid of you.<br>
53. They said: Be not afraid! Lo! we bring thee good tidings of a boy possessing<br>
wisdom.<br>
54. He said: Bring ye me good tidings [of a son] when old age hath overtaken me?<br>
Of what then can ye bring good tidings?<br>
55. They said: We bring thee good tidings in truth. So be not thou of the<br>
despairing.<br>
56. He said: And who despaireth of the mercy of his Lord save those who are<br>
astray?<br>
57. He said: And afterward what is your business, O ye messengers [of Allah]?<br>
58. They said: We have been sent unto a guilty folk,<br>
59. [All] save the family of Lot. Them we shall deliver every one,<br>
60. Except his wife, of whom We had decreed that she should be of those who stay<br>
behind.<br>
61. And when the messengers came unto the family of Lot,<br>
62. He said: Lo! ye are folk unknown [to me].<br>
63. They said: Nay, but we bring thee that concerning which they keep disputing,<br>
64. And bring thee the Truth, and lo! we are truth-tellers.<br>
65. So travel with thy household in a portion of the night, and follow thou<br>
their backs. Let none of you turn round, but go whither ye are commanded.<br>
66. And We made plain the case to him, that the root of them [who did wrong] was<br>
to be cut at early morn.<br>
67. And the people of the city came, rejoicing at the news [of new arrivals].<br>
68. He said: Lo! they are my guests. Affront me not!<br>
69. And keep your duty to Allah, and shame me not!<br>
70. They said; Have we not forbidden you from [entertaining] anyone?<br>
71. He said: Here are my daughters, if ye must be doing [so].<br>
72. By thy life [O Muhammad] they moved blindly in the frenzy of approaching<br>
death.<br>
73. Then the [Awful] Cry overtook them at the sunrise.<br>
74. And We utterly confounded them, and We rained upon them stones of heated<br>
clay.<br>
75. Lo! therein verily are portents for those who read the signs.<br>
76. And lo! it is upon a road still uneffaced.<br>
77. Lo! therein is indeed a portent for believers.<br>
<br>
118<br>
<br>
78. And the dwellers in the wood indeed were evil-doers.<br>
79. So we took vengeance on them; and lo! they both are on a high-road plain to<br>
see.<br>
80. And the dwellers in Al-Hijr denied [Our] messengers.<br>
81. And we gave them Our revelations, but they were averse to them.<br>
82. And they used to hew out dwellings from the hills, [wherein they dwelt]<br>
secure.<br>
83. But the [Awful] Cry overtook them at the morning hour,<br>
84. And that which they were wont to count as gain availed them not.<br>
85. We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save<br>
with truth, and lo! the Hour is surely coming. So forgive, [O Muhammad], with a<br>
gracious forgiveness.<br>
86. Lo! Thy Lord! He is the All-Wise Creator.<br>
87. We have given thee seven of the oft-repeated [verses] and the great Qur'an.<br>
88. Strain not thine eyes toward that which We cause some wedded pairs among<br>
them to enjoin, and be not grieved on their account, and lower thy wing [in<br>
tenderness] for the believers.<br>
89. And say: Lo! I, even I, am a plain warner,<br>
90. Such as We send down for those who make division,<br>
91. Those who break the Qur'an into parts.<br>
92. Them, by thy Lord, We shall question, every one,<br>
93. Of what they used to do.<br>
94. So proclaim that which thou art commanded, and withdraw from the idolaters.<br>
95. Lo! We defend thee from the scoffers,<br>
96. Who set some other god along with Allah. But they will come to know.<br>
97. Well know We that thy bosom is oppressed by what they say,<br>
98. But hymn the praise of thy Lord, and be of those who make prostration [unto<br>
Him].<br>
99. And serve thy Lord till the Inevitable cometh unto thee.<br>
<br>
SURA 16. AN-NAHL (THE BEE)<br>
1. The commandment of Allah will come to pass, so seek not ye to hasten it.<br>
Glorified and Exalted be He above all that they associate [with Him].<br>
2. He sendeth down the angels with the Spirit of His command unto whom He will<br>
of His bondmen, [saying]: Warn mankind that there is no Allah save Me, so keep<br>
your duty unto Me.<br>
3. He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth. High be He Exalted<br>
above all that they associate [with Him].<br>
4. He hath created man from a drop of fluid, yet behold! he is an open opponent.<br>
5. And the cattle hath He created, whence ye have warm clothing and uses, and<br>
whereof ye eat;<br>
<br>
119<br>
<br>
6. And wherein is beauty for you, when ye bring them home, and when ye take them<br>
out to pasture.<br>
7. And they bear your loads for you unto a land ye could not reach save with<br>
great trouble to yourselves. Lo! your Lord is Full of Pity, Merciful.<br>
8. And horses and mules and asses [hath He created] that ye may ride them, and<br>
for ornament. And He createth that which ye know not.<br>
9. And Allah's is the direction of the way, and some [roads] go not straight.<br>
And had He willed He would have led you all aright.<br>
10. He it is Who sendeth down water from the sky, whence ye have drink, and<br>
whence are trees on which ye send your beasts to pasture.<br>
11. Therewith He causeth crops to grow for you, and the olive and the date-palm<br>
and grapes and all kinds of fruit. Lo! herein is indeed a portent for people who<br>
reflect.<br>
12. And He hath constrained the night and the day and the sun and the moon to be<br>
of service unto you, and the stars are made subservient by His command. Lo!<br>
herein indeed are portents for people who have sense.<br>
13. And whatsoever He hath created for you in the earth of divers hues, lo!<br>
therein is indeed a portent for people who take heed.<br>
14. And He it is Who hath constrained the sea to be of service that ye eat fresh<br>
meat from thence, and bring forth from thence ornaments which ye wear. And thou<br>
seest the ships ploughing it that ye [mankind] may seek of His bounty and that<br>
haply ye may give thanks.<br>
15. And He hath cast into the earth firm hills that it quake not with you, and<br>
streams and roads that ye may find a way.<br>
16. And landmarks [too], and by the star they find a way.<br>
17. Is He then Who createth as him who createth not? Will ye not then remember?<br>
18. And if ye would count the favour of Allah ye cannot reckon it. Lo! Allah is<br>
indeed Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
19. And Allah knoweth that which ye keep hidden and that which ye proclaim.<br>
20. Those unto whom they cry beside Allah created naught, but are themselves<br>
created.<br>
21. [They are] dead, not living. And they know not when they will be raised.<br>
22. Your Allah is One Allah. But as for those who believe not in the Hereafter<br>
their hearts refuse to know, for they are proud.<br>
23. Assuredly Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they<br>
proclaim. Lo! He loveth not the proud.<br>
24. And when it is said unto them: What hath your Lord revealed? they say:<br>
[Mere] fables of the men of old,<br>
25. That they may bear their burdens undiminished on the Day of Resurrection,<br>
with somewhat of the burdens of those whom they mislead without knowledge. Ah!<br>
evil is that which they bear!<br>
26. Those before them plotted, so Allah struck at the foundations of their<br>
building, and then the roof fell down upon them from above them, and the doom<br>
came on them whence they knew not;<br>
<br>
120<br>
<br>
27. Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and will say: Where<br>
are My partners, for whose sake ye opposed [My guidance]? Those who have been<br>
given knowledge will say: Disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbelievers,<br>
28. Whom the angels cause to die while they are wronging themselves. Then will<br>
they make full submission [saying]: We used not to do any wrong. Nay! Surely<br>
Allah is Knower of what ye used to do.<br>
29. So enter the gates of hell, to dwell therein for ever. Woeful indeed will be<br>
the lodging of the arrogant.<br>
30. And it is said unto those who ward off [evil]: What hath your Lord revealed?<br>
They say: Good. For those who do good in this world there is a good [reward] and<br>
the home of the Hereafter will be better. Pleasant indeed will be the home of<br>
those who ward off [evil] 31. Gardens of Eden which they enter, underneath which rivers flow, wherein they<br>
have what they will. Thus Allah repayeth those who ward off [evil],<br>
32. Those whom the angels cause to die [when they are] good. They say: Peace be<br>
unto you! Enter the Garden because of what ye used to do.<br>
33. Await they aught say that the angels should come unto them or thy Lord's<br>
command should come to pass? Even so did those before them. Allah wronged them<br>
not, but they did wrong themselves,<br>
34. So that the evils of what they did smote them, and that which they used to<br>
mock surrounded them.<br>
35. And the idolaters say: Had Allah willed, we had not worshipped aught beside<br>
Him, we and our fathers, nor had we forbidden aught without [command from] Him.<br>
Even so did those before them. Are the messengers charged with aught save plain<br>
conveyance [of the message]?<br>
36. And verily We have raised in every nation a messenger, [proclaiming]: Serve<br>
Allah and shun false gods. Then some of them [there were] whom Allah guided, and<br>
some of them [there were] upon whom error had just hold. Do but travel in the<br>
land and see the nature of the consequence for the deniers!<br>
37. Even if thou [O Muhammad] desirest their right guidance, still Allah<br>
assuredly will not guide him who misleadeth. Such have no helpers.<br>
38. And they swear by Allah their most binding oaths [that] Allah will not raise<br>
up him who dieth. Nay, but it is a promise [binding] upon Him in truth, but most<br>
of mankind know not,<br>
39. That He may explain unto them that wherein they differ, and that those who<br>
disbelieved may know that they were liars.<br>
40. And Our word unto a thing, when We intend it, is only that We say unto it:<br>
Be! and it is.<br>
41. And those who became fugitives for the cause of Allah after they had been<br>
oppressed, We verily shall give them goodly lodging in the world, and surely the<br>
reward of the Hereafter is greater, if they but knew;<br>
42. Such as are steadfast and put their trust in Allah.<br>
43. And We sent not [as Our messengers] before thee other than men whom We<br>
inspired - Ask the followers of the Remembrance if ye know not! 44. With clear proofs and writings; and We have revealed unto thee the<br>
Remembrance that thou mayst explain to mankind that which hath been revealed for<br>
them, and that haply they may reflect.<br>
<br>
121<br>
<br>
45. Are they who plan ill-deeds then secure that Allah will not cause the earth<br>
to swallow them, or that the doom will not come on them whence they know not?<br>
46. Or that He will not seize them in their going to and fro so that there be no<br>
escape for them?<br>
47. Or that He will not seize them with a gradual wasting? Lo! thy Lord is<br>
indeed Full of Pity, Merciful.<br>
48. Have they not observed all things that Allah hath created, how their shadows<br>
incline to the right and to the left, making prostration unto Allah, and they<br>
are lowly?<br>
49. And unto Allah maketh prostration whatsoever is in the heavens and<br>
whatsoever is in the earth of living creatures, and the angels [also] and they<br>
are not proud.<br>
50. They fear their Lord above them, and do what they are bidden.<br>
51. Allah hath said: Choose not two gods. There is only One Allah. So of Me, Me<br>
only, be in awe.<br>
52. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth, and religion<br>
is His for ever. Will ye then fear any other than Allah?<br>
53. And whatever of comfort ye enjoy, it is from Allah. Then, when misfortune<br>
reacheth you, unto Him ye cry for help.<br>
54. And afterward, when He hath rid you of the misfortune, behold! a set of you<br>
attribute partners to their Lord,<br>
55. So as to deny that which We have given them. Then enjoy life [while ye may],<br>
for ye will come to know.<br>
56. And they assign a portion of that which We have given them unto what they<br>
know not. By Allah! but ye will indeed be asked concerning [all] that ye used to<br>
invent.<br>
57. And they assign unto Allah daughters - Be He Glorified! - and unto<br>
themselves what they desire;<br>
58. When if one of them receiveth tidings of the birth of a female, his face<br>
remaineth darkened, and he is wroth inwardly.<br>
59. He hideth himself from the folk because of the evil of that whereof he hath<br>
had tidings, [asking himself]: Shall he keep it in contempt, or bury it beneath<br>
the dust. Verily evil is their judgment.<br>
60. For those who believe not in the Hereafter is an evil similitude, and<br>
Allah's is the Sublime Similitude. He is the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
61. If Allah were to take mankind to task for their wrong-doing, he would not<br>
leave hereon a living creature, but He reprieveth them to an appointed term, and<br>
when their term cometh they cannot put [it] off an hour nor [yet] advance [it].<br>
62. And they assign unto Allah that which they [themselves] dislike, and their<br>
tongues expound the lie that the better portion will be theirs. Assuredly theirs<br>
will be the Fire, and they will be abandoned.<br>
63. By Allah, We verily sent messengers unto the nations before thee, but the<br>
devil made their deeds fairseeming unto them. So he is their patron this day,<br>
and theirs will be a painful doom.<br>
64. And We have revealed the Scripture unto thee only that thou mayst explain<br>
unto them that wherein they differ, and [as] a guidance and a mercy for a people<br>
who believe.<br>
122<br>
<br>
65. Allah sendeth down water from the sky and therewith reviveth the earth after<br>
her death. Lo! herein is indeed a portent for a folk who hear.<br>
66. And lo! in the cattle there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink of<br>
that which is in their bellies, from betwixt the refuse and the blood, pure milk<br>
palatable to the drinkers.<br>
67. And of the fruits of the date-palm, and grapes, whence ye derive strong<br>
drink and [also] good nourishment. Lo! therein is indeed a portent for people<br>
who have sense.<br>
68. And thy Lord inspired the bee, saying: Choose thou habitations in the hills<br>
and in the trees and in that which they thatch;<br>
69. Then eat of all fruits, and follow the ways of thy Lord, made smooth [for<br>
thee]. There cometh forth from their bellies a drink divers of hues, wherein is<br>
healing for mankind. Lo! herein is indeed a portent for people who reflect.<br>
70. And Allah createth you, then causeth you to die, and among you is he who is<br>
brought back to the most abject stage of life, so that he knoweth nothing after<br>
[having had] knowledge. Lo! Allah is Knower, Powerful.<br>
71. And Allah hath favoured some of you above others in provision. Now those who<br>
are more favoured will by no means hand over their provision to those [slaves]<br>
whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal with them in respect<br>
thereof. Is it then the grace of Allah that they deny?<br>
72. And Allah hath given you wives of your own kind, and hath given you, from<br>
your wives, sons and grandsons, and hath made provision of good things for you.<br>
Is it then in vanity that they believe and in the grace of Allah that they<br>
disbelieve?<br>
73. And they worship beside Allah that which owneth no provision whatsoever for<br>
them from the heavens or the earth, nor have they [whom they worship] any power.<br>
74. So coin not similitudes for Allah. Lo! Allah knoweth; ye know not.<br>
75. Allah coineth a similitude: [on the one hand] a [mere] chattel slave, who<br>
hath control of nothing, and [on the other hand] one on whom we have bestowed a<br>
fair provision from Us, and he spendeth thereof secretly and openly. Are they<br>
equal? Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not.<br>
76. And Allah coineth a similitude: Two men, one of them dumb, having control of<br>
nothing, and he is a burden on his owner; whithersoever he directeth him to go,<br>
he bringeth no good. Is he equal with one who enjoineth justice and followeth a<br>
straight path [of conduct]?<br>
77. And unto Allah belongeth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth, and the<br>
matter of the Hour [of Doom] is but as a twinkling of the eye, or it is nearer<br>
still. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
78. And Allah brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers knowing nothing,<br>
and gave you hearing and sight and hearts that haply ye might give thanks.<br>
79. Have they not seen the birds obedient in mid-air? None holdeth them save<br>
Allah. Lo! herein, verily, are portents for a people who believe.<br>
80. And Allah hath given you in your houses an abode, and hath given you [also],<br>
of the hides of cattle, houses which ye find light [to carry] on the day of<br>
migration and on the day of pitching camp; and of their wool and their fur and<br>
their hair, caparison and comfort for a while.<br>
81. And Allah hath given you, of that which He hath created, shelter from the<br>
sun; and hath given you places of refuge in the mountains, and hath given you<br>
<br>
123<br>
<br>
coats to ward off the heat from you, and coats [of armour] to save you from your<br>
own foolhardiness. Thus doth He perfect His favour unto you, in order that ye<br>
may surrender [unto Him].<br>
82. Then, if they turn away, thy duty [O Muhammad] is but plain conveyance [of<br>
the message].<br>
83. They know the favour of Allah and then deny it. Most of them are ingrates.<br>
84. And [bethink you of] the day when we raise up of every nation a witness,<br>
then there is no leave for disbelievers, nor are they allowed to make amends.<br>
85. And when those who did wrong behold the doom, it will not be made light for<br>
them, nor will they be reprieved.<br>
86. And when those who ascribed partners to Allah behold those partners of<br>
theirs, they will say: Our Lord! these are our partners unto whom we used to cry<br>
instead of Thee. But they will fling to them the saying: Lo! ye verily are<br>
liars!<br>
87. And they proffer unto Allah submission on that day, and all that they used<br>
to invent hath failed them.<br>
88. For those who disbelieve and debar [men] from the way of Allah, We add doom<br>
to doom because they wrought corruption,<br>
89. And [bethink you of] the day when We raise in every nation a witness against<br>
them of their own folk, and We bring thee [Muhammad] as a witness against these.<br>
And We reveal the Scripture unto thee as an exposition of all things, and a<br>
guidance and a mercy and good tidings for those who have surrendered [to Allah].<br>
90. Lo! Allah enjoineth justice and kindness, and giving to kinsfolk, and<br>
forbiddeth lewdness and abomination and wickedness. He exhorteth you in order<br>
that ye may take heed.<br>
91. Fulfil the covenant of Allah when ye have covenanted, and break not your<br>
oaths after the asseveration of them, and after ye have made Allah surety over<br>
you. Lo! Allah knoweth what ye do.<br>
92. And be not like unto her who unravelleth the thread, after she hath made it<br>
strong, to thin filaments, making your oaths a deceit between you because of a<br>
nation being more numerous than [another] nation. Allah only trieth you thereby,<br>
and He verily will explain to you on the Day of Resurrection that wherein ye<br>
differed.<br>
93. Had Allah willed He could have made you [all] one nation, but He sendeth<br>
whom He will astray and guideth whom He will, and ye will indeed be asked of<br>
what ye used to do.<br>
94. Make not your oaths a deceit between you, lest a foot should slip after<br>
being firmly planted and ye should taste evil forasmuch as ye debarred [men]<br>
from the way of Allah, and yours should be an awful doom.<br>
95. And purchase not a small gain at the price of Allah's covenant. Lo! that<br>
which Allah hath is better for you, if ye did but know.<br>
96. That which ye have wasteth away, and that which Allah hath remaineth. And<br>
verily We shall pay those who are steadfast a recompense in proportion to the<br>
best of what they used to do.<br>
97. Whosoever doeth right, whether male or female, and is a believer, him verily<br>
we shall quicken with good life, and We shall pay them a recompense in<br>
proportion to the best of what they used to do.<br>
<br>
124<br>
<br>
98. And when thou recitest the Qur'an, seek refuge in Allah from Satan the<br>
outcast.<br>
99. Lo! he hath no power over those who believe and put trust in their Lord.<br>
100. His power is only over those who make a friend of him, and those who<br>
ascribe partners unto Him [Allah].<br>
101. And when We put a revelation in place of [another] revelation, - and Allah<br>
knoweth best what He revealeth - they say: Lo! thou art but inventing. Most of<br>
them know not.<br>
102. Say: The holy Spirit hath delivered it from thy Lord with truth, that it<br>
may confirm [the faith of] those who believe, and as guidance and good tidings<br>
for those who have surrendered [to Allah].<br>
103. And We know well that they say: Only a man teacheth him. The speech of him<br>
at whom they falsely hint is outlandish, and this is clear Arabic speech.<br>
104. Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah, Allah guideth them not<br>
and theirs will be a painful doom.<br>
105. Only they invent falsehood who believe not Allah's revelations, and [only]<br>
they are the liars.<br>
106. Whoso disbelieveth in Allah after his belief - save him who is forced<br>
thereto and whose heart is still content with the Faith - but whoso findeth ease<br>
in disbelief: On them is wrath from Allah. Theirs will be an awful doom.<br>
107. That is because they have chosen the life of the world rather than the<br>
Hereafter, and because Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk.<br>
108. Such are they whose hearts and ears and eyes Allah hath sealed. And such<br>
are the heedless.<br>
109. Assuredly in the Hereafter they are the losers.<br>
110. Then lo! thy Lord - for those who became fugitives after they had been<br>
persecuted, and then fought and were steadfast - lo! thy Lord afterward is [for<br>
them] indeed Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
111. On the Day when every soul will come pleading for itself, and every soul<br>
will be repaid what it did, and they will not be wronged.<br>
112. Allah coineth a similitude: a township that dwelt secure and well content,<br>
its provision coming to it in abundance from every side, but it disbelieved in<br>
Allah's favours, so Allah made it experience the garb of dearth and fear because<br>
of what they used to do.<br>
113. And verily there had come unto them a messenger from among them, but they<br>
had denied him, and so the torment seized them while they were wrong-doers.<br>
114. So eat of the lawful and good food which Allah hath provided for you, and<br>
thank the bounty of your Lord if it is Him ye serve.<br>
115. He hath forbidden for you only carrion and blood and swineflesh and that<br>
which hath been immolated in the name of any other than Allah; but he who is<br>
driven thereto, neither craving nor transgressing, lo! then Allah is Forgiving,<br>
Merciful.<br>
116. And speak not, concerning that which your own tongues qualify [as clean or<br>
unclean], the falsehood: "This is lawful, and this is forbidden," so that ye<br>
invent a lie against Allah. Lo! those who invent a lie against Allah will not<br>
succeed.<br>
117. A brief enjoyment [will be theirs]; and theirs a painful doom.<br>
125<br>
<br>
118. And unto those who are Jews We have forbidden that which We have already<br>
related unto thee. And We wronged them not, but they were wont to wrong<br>
themselves.<br>
119. Then lo! thy Lord - for those who do evil in ignorance and afterward repent<br>
and amend - lo! [for them] thy Lord is afterward indeed Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
120. Lo! Abraham was a nation obedient to Allah, by nature upright, and he was<br>
not of the idolaters;<br>
121. Thankful for His bounties; He chose him and He guided him unto a straight<br>
path.<br>
122. And We gave him good in the world, and in the Hereafter he is among the<br>
righteous.<br>
123. And afterward We inspired thee [Muhammad, saying]: Follow the religion of<br>
Abraham, as one by nature upright. He was not of the idolaters.<br>
124. The Sabbath was appointed only for those who differed concerning it, and<br>
lo! thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that<br>
wherein they used to differ.<br>
125. Call unto the way of thy Lord with wisdom and fair exhortation, and reason<br>
with them in the better way. Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from<br>
His way, and He is Best Aware of those who go aright.<br>
126. If ye punish, then punish with the like of that wherewith ye were<br>
afflicted. But if ye endure patiently, verily it is better for the patient.<br>
127. Endure thou patiently [O Muhammad]. Thine endurance is only by [the help<br>
of] Allah. Grieve not for them, and be not in distress because of that which<br>
they devise.<br>
128. Lo! Allah is with those who keep their duty unto Him and those who are<br>
doers of good.<br>
<br>
SURA 17. AL-ISRA (ISRA', THE NIGHT JOURNEY,<br>
CHILDREN OF ISRAEL)<br>
1. Glorified be He Who carried His servant by night from the Inviolable Place of<br>
Worship to the Far distant place of worship the neighbourhood whereof We have<br>
blessed, that We might show him of Our tokens! Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer,<br>
the Seer.<br>
2. We gave unto Moses the Scripture, and We appointed it a guidance for the<br>
children of Israel, saying: Choose no guardian beside Me.<br>
3. [They were] the seed of those whom We carried [in the ship] along with Noah.<br>
Lo! he was a grateful slave.<br>
4. And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture: Ye verily will<br>
work corruption in the earth twice, and ye will become great tyrants.<br>
5. So when the time for the first of the two came, We roused against you slaves<br>
of Ours of great might who ravaged [your] country, and it was a threat<br>
performed.<br>
6. Then we gave you once again your turn against them, and We aided you with<br>
wealth and children and made you more in soldiery.<br>
<br>
126<br>
<br>
7. [Saying]: If ye do good, ye do good for your own souls, and if ye do evil, it<br>
is for them [in like manner]. So, when the time for the second [of the<br>
judgments] came [We roused against you others of Our slaves] to ravage you, and<br>
to enter the Temple even as they entered it the first time, and to lay waste all<br>
that they conquered with an utter wasting.<br>
8. It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you, but if ye repeat [the crime]<br>
We shall repeat [the punishment], and We have appointed hell a dungeon for the<br>
disbelievers.<br>
9. Lo! this Qur'an guideth unto that which is straightest, and giveth tidings<br>
unto the believers who do good works that theirs will be a great reward.<br>
10. And that those who believe not in the Hereafter, for them We have prepared a<br>
painful doom.<br>
11. Man prayeth for evil as he prayeth for good; for man was ever hasty.<br>
12. And We appoint the night and the day two portents. Then We make dark the<br>
portent of the night, and We make the portent of the day sight-giving, that ye<br>
may seek bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know the computation of the<br>
years, and the reckoning; and everything have We expounded with a clear<br>
expounding.<br>
13. And every man's augury have We fastened to his own neck, and We shall bring<br>
forth for him on the Day of Resurrection a book which he will find wide open.<br>
14. [And it will be said unto him]: Read thy Book. Thy soul sufficeth as<br>
reckoner against thee this day.<br>
15. Whosoever goeth right, it is only for [the good of] his own soul that he<br>
goeth right, and whosoever erreth, erreth only to its hurt. No laden soul can<br>
bear another's load, We never punish until we have sent a messenger.<br>
16. And when We would destroy a township We send commandment to its folk who<br>
live at ease, and afterward they commit abomination therein, and so the Word [of<br>
doom] hath effect for it, and we annihilate it with complete annihilation.<br>
17. How many generations have We destroyed since Noah! And Allah sufficeth as<br>
Knower and Beholder of the sins of His slaves.<br>
18. Whoso desireth that [life] which hasteneth away, We hasten for him therein<br>
what We will for whom We please. And afterward We have appointed for him hell;<br>
he will endure the heat thereof, condemned, rejected.<br>
19. And whoso desireth the Hereafter and striveth for it with the effort<br>
necessary, being a believer; for such, their effort findeth favour [with their<br>
Lord].<br>
20. Each do We supply, both these and those, from the bounty of thy Lord. And<br>
the bounty of thy Lord can never be walled up.<br>
21. See how We prefer one of them above another, and verily the Hereafter will<br>
be greater in degrees and greater in preferment.<br>
22. Set not up with Allah any other god [O man] lest thou sit down reproved,<br>
forsaken.<br>
23. Thy Lord hath decreed, that ye worship none save Him, and [that ye show]<br>
kindness to parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age with thee,<br>
say not "Fie" unto them nor repulse them, but speak unto them a gracious word.<br>
24. And lower unto them the wing of submission through mercy, and say: My Lord!<br>
Have mercy on them both as they did care for me when I was little.<br>
<br>
127<br>
<br>
25. Your Lord is Best Aware of what is in your minds. If ye are righteous, then<br>
lo! He was ever Forgiving unto those who turn [unto Him].<br>
26. Give the kinsman his due, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and squander not<br>
[thy wealth] in wantonness.<br>
27. Lo! the squanderers were ever brothers of the devils, and the devil was ever<br>
an ingrate to his Lord.<br>
28. But if thou turn away from them, seeking mercy from thy Lord, for which thou<br>
hopest, then speak unto them a reasonable word.<br>
29. And let not thy hand be chained to thy neck nor open it with a complete<br>
opening, lest thou sit down rebuked, denuded.<br>
30. Lo! thy Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will, and straiteneth [it<br>
for whom He will]. Lo, He was ever Knower, Seer of His slaves.<br>
31. Slay not your children, fearing a fall to poverty, We shall provide for them<br>
and for you. Lo! the slaying of them is great sin.<br>
32. And come not near unto adultery. Lo! it is an abomination and an evil way.<br>
33. And slay not the life which Allah hath forbidden save with right. Whoso is<br>
slain wrongfully, We have given power unto his heir, but let him not commit<br>
excess in slaying. Lo! he will be helped.<br>
34. Come not near the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better till<br>
he come to strength; and keep the covenant. Lo! of the covenant it will be<br>
asked.<br>
35. Fill the measure when ye measure, and weigh with a right balance; that is<br>
meet, and better in the end.<br>
36. [O man], follow not that whereof thou hast no knowledge. Lo! the hearing and<br>
the sight and the heart - of each of these it will be asked.<br>
37. And walk not in the earth exultant. Lo! thou canst not rend the earth, nor<br>
canst thou stretch to the height of the hills.<br>
38. The evil of all that is hateful in the sight of thy Lord.<br>
39. This is [part] of that wisdom wherewith thy Lord hath inspired thee [O<br>
Muhammad]. And set not up with Allah any other god, lest thou be cast into hell,<br>
reproved, abandoned.<br>
40. Hath your Lord then distinguished you [O men of Makka] by giving you sons,<br>
and hath chosen for Himself females from among the angels? Lo! verily ye speak<br>
an awful word!<br>
41. We verily have displayed [Our warnings] in this Qur'an that they may take<br>
heed, but it increaseth them in naught save aversion.<br>
42. Say [O Muhammad, to the disbelievers]: If there were other gods along with<br>
Him, as they say, then had they sought a way against the Lord of the Throne.<br>
43. Glorified is He, and High Exalted above what they say!<br>
44. The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein praise Him, and<br>
there is not a thing but hymneth His praise; but ye understand not their praise.<br>
Lo! He is ever Clement, Forgiving.<br>
45. And when thou recitest the Qur'an we place between thee and those who<br>
believe not in the Hereafter a hidden barrier;<br>
<br>
128<br>
<br>
46. And We place upon their hearts veils lest they should understand it, and in<br>
their ears a deafness; and when thou makest mention of thy Lord alone in the<br>
Qur'an, they turn their backs in aversion.<br>
47. We are Best Aware of what they wish to hear when they give ear to thee and<br>
when they take secret counsel, when the evil-doers say: Ye follow but a man<br>
bewitched.<br>
48. See what similitudes they coin for thee, and thus are all astray, and cannot<br>
find a road!<br>
49. And they say: When we are bones and fragments, shall we forsooth, be raised<br>
up as a new creation?<br>
50. Say: Be ye stones or iron<br>
51. Or some created thing that is yet greater in your thoughts! Then they will<br>
say: Who shall bring us back [to life]. Say: He Who created you at the first.<br>
Then will they shake their heads at thee, and say: When will it be? Say: It will<br>
perhaps be soon;<br>
52. A day when He will call you and ye will answer with His praise, and ye will<br>
think that ye have tarried but a little while.<br>
53. Tell My bondmen to speak that which is kindlier. Lo! the devil soweth<br>
discord among them. Lo! the devil is for man an open foe.<br>
54. Your Lord is Best Aware of you. If He will, He will have mercy on you, or if<br>
He will, He will punish you. We have not sent thee [O Muhammad] as a warden over<br>
them.<br>
55. And thy Lord is Best Aware of all who are in the heavens and the earth. And<br>
we preferred some of the prophets above others, and unto David We gave the<br>
Psalms.<br>
56. Say: Cry unto those [saints and angels] whom ye assume [to be gods] beside<br>
Him, yet they have no power to rid you of misfortune nor to change.<br>
57. Those unto whom they cry seek the way of approach to their Lord, which of<br>
them shall be the nearest; they hope for His mercy and they fear His doom. Lo!<br>
the doom of thy Lord is to be shunned.<br>
58. There is not a township but We shall destroy it ere the Day of Resurrection,<br>
or punish it with dire punishment. That is set forth in the Book [of Our<br>
decrees].<br>
59. Naught hindereth Us from sending portents save that the folk of old denied<br>
them. And We gave Thamud the she-camel - a clear portent save to warn.<br>
60. And [it was a warning] when we told thee: Lo! thy Lord encompasseth mankind,<br>
and We appointed the sight which We showed thee as an ordeal for mankind, and<br>
[likewise] the Accursed Tree in the Qur'an. We warn them, but it increaseth them<br>
in naught save gross impiety.<br>
61. And when We said unto the angels: Fall down prostrate before Adam and they<br>
fell prostrate all save Iblis, he said: Shall I fall prostrate before that which<br>
Thou hast created of clay?<br>
62. He said: Seest Thou this [creature] whom Thou hast honoured above me, if<br>
Thou give me grace until the Day of Resurrection I verily will seize his seed,<br>
save but a few.<br>
63. He said: Go, and whosoever of them followeth thee - lo! hell will be your<br>
payment, ample payment.<br>
<br>
129<br>
<br>
64. And excite any of them whom thou canst with thy voice, and urge thy horse<br>
and foot against them, and be a partner in their wealth and children, and<br>
promise them. Satan promiseth them only to deceive.<br>
65. Lo! My [faithful] bondmen - over them thou hast no power, and thy Lord<br>
sufficeth as [their] guardian.<br>
66. [O mankind], your Lord is He Who driveth for you the ship upon the sea that<br>
ye may seek of His bounty. Lo! He was ever Merciful toward you.<br>
67. And when harm toucheth you upon the sea, all unto whom ye cry [for succour]<br>
fail save Him [alone], but when He bringeth you safe to land, ye turn away, for<br>
man was ever thankless.<br>
68. Feel ye then secure that He will not cause a slope of the land to engulf<br>
you, or send a sand-storm upon you, and then ye will find that ye have no<br>
protector?<br>
69. Or feel ye secure that He will not return you to that [plight] a second<br>
time, and send against you a hurricane of wind and drown you for your<br>
thanklessness, and then ye will not find therein that ye have any avenger<br>
against Us?<br>
70. Verily we have honoured the Children of Adam. We carry them on the land and<br>
the sea, and have made provision of good things for them, and have preferred<br>
them above many of those whom We created with a marked preferment.<br>
71. On the day when We shall summon all men with their record, whoso is given<br>
his book in his right hand - such will read their book and they will not be<br>
wronged a shred.<br>
72. Whoso is blind here will be blind in the Hereafter, and yet further from the<br>
road.<br>
73. And they indeed strove hard to beguile thee [Muhammad] away from that<br>
wherewith We have inspired thee, that thou shouldst invent other than it against<br>
Us; and then would they have accepted thee as a friend.<br>
74. And if We had not made thee wholly firm thou mightest almost have inclined<br>
unto them a little.<br>
75. Then had we made thee taste a double [punishment] of living and a double<br>
[punishment] of dying, then hadst thou found no helper against Us.<br>
76. And they indeed wished to scare thee from the land that they might drive<br>
thee forth from thence, and then they would have stayed [there] but a little<br>
after thee.<br>
77. [Such was Our] method in the case of those whom We sent before thee [to<br>
mankind], and thou wilt not find for Our method aught of power to change.<br>
78. Establish worship at the going down of the sun until the dark of night, and<br>
[the recital of] the Qur'an at dawn. Lo! [the recital of] the Qur'an at dawn is<br>
ever witnessed.<br>
79. And some part of the night awake for it, a largess for thee. It may be that<br>
thy Lord will raise thee to a praised estate.<br>
80. And say: My Lord! Cause me to come in with a firm incoming and to go out<br>
with a firm outgoing. And give me from Thy presence a sustaining Power.<br>
81. And say: Truth hath come and falsehood hath vanished away. Lo! falsehood is<br>
ever bound to vanish.<br>
<br>
130<br>
<br>
82. And We reveal of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy for<br>
believers though it increase the evil-doers in naught save ruin.<br>
83. And when We make life pleasant unto man, he turneth away and is averse; and<br>
when ill toucheth him he is in despair.<br>
84. Say: Each one doth according to his rule of conduct, and thy Lord is Best<br>
Aware of him whose way is right.<br>
85. They are asking thee concerning the Spirit. Say: The Spirit is by command of<br>
my Lord, and of knowledge ye have been vouchsafed but little.<br>
86. And if We willed We could withdraw that which We have revealed unto thee,<br>
then wouldst thou find no guardian for thee against Us in respect thereof.<br>
87. [It is naught] save mercy from thy Lord. Lo! His kindness unto thee was ever<br>
great.<br>
88. Say: Verily, though mankind and the jinn should assemble to produce the like<br>
of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof though they were helpers<br>
one of another.<br>
89. And verily We have displayed for mankind in this Qur'an all kind of<br>
similitudes, but most of mankind refuse aught save disbelief.<br>
90. And they say: We will not put faith in thee till thou cause a spring to gush<br>
forth from the earth for us;<br>
91. Or thou have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush<br>
forth therein abundantly;<br>
92. Or thou cause the heaven to fall upon us piecemeal, as thou hast pretended,<br>
or bring Allah and the angels as a warrant;<br>
93. Or thou have a house of gold; or thou ascend up into heaven, and even then<br>
we will put no faith in thine ascension till thou bring down for us a book that<br>
we can read. Say [O Muhammad]: My Lord be Glorified! Am I aught save a mortal<br>
messenger?<br>
94. And naught prevented mankind from believing when the guidance came unto them<br>
save that they said: Hath Allah sent a mortal as [His] messenger?<br>
95. Say: If there were in the earth angels walking secure, We had sent down for<br>
them from heaven an angel as messenger.<br>
96. Say: Allah sufficeth for a witness between me and you. Lo! He is Knower,<br>
Seer of His slaves.<br>
97. And he whom Allah guideth, he is led aright; while, as for him whom He<br>
sendeth astray, for them thou wilt find no protecting friends beside Him, and We<br>
shall assemble them on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and<br>
deaf; their habitation will be hell; whenever it abateth, We increase the flame<br>
for them.<br>
98. That is their reward because they disbelieved Our revelations and said: When<br>
we are bones and fragments shall we, forsooth, be raised up as a new creation?<br>
99. Have they not seen that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth is Able<br>
to create the like of them, and hath appointed for them an end whereof there is<br>
no doubt? But the wrong-doers refuse aught save disbelief.<br>
100. Say [unto them]: If ye possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, ye<br>
would surely hold them back for fear of spending, for man was ever grudging.<br>
<br>
131<br>
<br>
101. And verily We gave unto Moses nine tokens, clear proofs [of Allah's<br>
Sovereignty]. Do but ask the Children of Israel how he came unto them, then<br>
Pharaoh said unto him: Lo! I deem thee one bewitched, O Moses.<br>
102. He said: In truth thou knowest that none sent down these [portents] save<br>
the Lord of the heavens and the earth as proofs, and lo! [for my part] I deem<br>
thee lost, O Pharaoh.<br>
103. And he wished to scare them from the land, but We drowned him and those<br>
with him, all together.<br>
104. And We said unto the Children of Israel after him: Dwell in the land; but<br>
when the promise of the Hereafter cometh to pass We shall bring you as a crowd<br>
gathered out of various nations.<br>
105. With truth have We sent it down, and with truth hath it descended. And We<br>
have sent thee as naught else save a bearer of good tidings and a warner.<br>
106. And [it is] a Qur'an that We have divided, that thou mayst recite it unto<br>
mankind at intervals, and We have revealed it by [successive] revelation.<br>
107. Say: Believe therein or believe not, lo! those who were given knowledge<br>
before it, when it is read unto them, fall down prostrate on their faces,<br>
adoring,<br>
108. Saying: Glory to our Lord! Verily the promise of our Lord must be<br>
fulfilled.<br>
109. They fall down on their faces, weeping, and it increaseth humility in them.<br>
110. Say [unto mankind]: Cry unto Allah, or cry unto the Beneficent, unto<br>
whichsoever ye cry [it is the same]. His are the most beautiful names. And thou<br>
[Muhammad], be not loud-voiced in thy worship nor yet silent therein, but follow<br>
a way between.<br>
111. And say: Praise be to Allah, Who hath not taken unto Himself a son, and Who<br>
hath no partner in the Sovereignty, nor hath He any protecting friend through<br>
dependence. And magnify Him with all magnificence.<br>
<br>
SURA 18. AL-KAHF (THE CAVE)<br>
1. Praise be to Allah Who hath revealed the Scripture unto His slave, and hath<br>
not placed therein any crookedness,<br>
2. [But hath made it] straight, to give warning of stern punishment from Him,<br>
and to bring unto the believers who do good works the news that theirs will be a<br>
fair reward,<br>
3. Wherein they will abide for ever;<br>
4. And to warn those who say: Allah hath chosen a son,<br>
5. [A thing] whereof they have no knowledge, nor [had] their fathers, Dreadful<br>
is the word that cometh out of their mouths. They speak naught but a lie.<br>
6. Yet it may be, if they believe not in this statement, that thou [Muhammad]<br>
wilt torment thy soul with grief over their footsteps.<br>
7. Lo! We have placed all that is on the earth as an ornament thereof that We<br>
may try them: which of them is best in conduct.<br>
8. And lo! We shall make all that is thereon a barren mound.<br>
<br>
132<br>
<br>
9. Or deemest thou that the People of the Cave and the Inscription are a wonder<br>
among Our portents?<br>
10. When the young men fled for refuge to the Cave and said: Our Lord! Give us<br>
mercy from Thy presence, and shape for us right conduct in our plight.<br>
11. Then We sealed up their hearing in the Cave for a number of years.<br>
12. And afterward We raised them up that We might know which of the two parties<br>
would best calculate the time that they had tarried.<br>
13. We narrate unto thee their story with truth. Lo! they were young men who<br>
believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.<br>
14. And We made firm their hearts when they stood forth and said: Our Lord is<br>
the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We cry unto no Allah beside Him, for then<br>
should we utter an enormity.<br>
15. These, our people, have chosen [other] gods beside Him though they bring no<br>
clear warrant [vouchsafed] to them. And who doth greater wrong than he who<br>
inventeth a lie concerning Allah?<br>
16. And when ye withdraw from them and that which they worship except Allah,<br>
then seek refuge in the Cave; your Lord will spread for you of His mercy and<br>
will prepare for you a pillow in your plight.<br>
17. And thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away from their cave<br>
to the right, and when it set go past them on the left, and they were in the<br>
cleft thereof. That was [one] of the portents of Allah. He whom Allah guideth,<br>
he indeed is led aright, and he whom He sendeth astray, for him thou wilt not<br>
find a guiding friend.<br>
18. And thou wouldst have deemed them waking though they were asleep, and We<br>
caused them to turn over to the right and the left, and their dog stretching out<br>
his paws on the threshold. If thou hadst observed them closely thou hadst<br>
assuredly turned away from them in flight, and hadst been filled with awe of<br>
them.<br>
19. And in like manner We awakened them that they might question one another. A<br>
speaker from among them said: How long have ye tarried? They said: We have<br>
tarried a day or some part of a day, [Others] said: Your Lord best knoweth what<br>
ye have tarried. Now send one of you with this your silver coin unto the city,<br>
and let him see what food is purest there and bring you a supply thereof. Let<br>
him be courteous and let no man know of you.<br>
20. For they, if they should come to know of you, will stone you or turn you<br>
back to their religion; then ye will never prosper.<br>
21. And in like manner We disclosed them [to the people of the city] that they<br>
might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that, as for the Hour, there<br>
is no doubt concerning it. When [the people of the city] disputed of their case<br>
among themselves, they said: Build over them a building; their Lord knoweth best<br>
concerning them. Those who won their point said: We verily shall build a place<br>
of worship over them.<br>
22. [Some] will say: They were three, their dog the fourth, and [some] say:<br>
Five, their dog the sixth, guessing at random; and [some] say: Seven, and their<br>
dog the eighth. Say [O Muhammad]: My Lord is Best Aware of their number. None<br>
knoweth them save a few. So contend not concerning them except with an outward<br>
contending, and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them.<br>
23. And say not of anything: Lo! I shall do that tomorrow,<br>
<br>
133<br>
<br>
24. Except if Allah will. And remember thy Lord when thou forgettest, and say:<br>
It may be that my Lord guideth me unto a nearer way of truth than this.<br>
25. And [it is said] they tarried in their Cave three hundred years and add<br>
nine.<br>
26. Say: Allah is Best Aware how long they tarried. His is the Invisible of the<br>
heavens and the earth. How clear of sight is He and keen of hearing! They have<br>
no protecting friend beside Him, and He maketh none to share in His government.<br>
27. And recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the Scripture of thy<br>
Lord. There is none who can change His words, and thou wilt find no refuge<br>
beside Him.<br>
28. Restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their Lord at morn and<br>
evening, seeking His Countenance; and let not thine eyes overlook them, desiring<br>
the pomp of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made<br>
heedless of Our remembrance, who followeth his own lust and whose case hath been<br>
abandoned.<br>
29. Say: [It is] the truth from the Lord of you [all]. Then whosoever will, let<br>
him believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve. Lo! We have prepared for<br>
disbelievers Fire. Its tent encloseth them. If they ask for showers, they will<br>
be showered with water like to molten lead which burneth the faces. Calamitous<br>
the drink and ill the resting-place!<br>
30. Lo! as for those who believe and do good works - Lo! We suffer not the<br>
reward of one whose work is goodly to be lost.<br>
31. As for such, theirs will be Gardens of Eden, wherein rivers flow beneath<br>
them; therein they will be given armlets of gold and will wear green robes of<br>
finest silk and gold embroidery, reclining upon throne therein. Blest the<br>
reward, and fair the resting-place!<br>
32. Coin for them a similitude: Two men, unto one of whom We had assigned two<br>
gardens of grapes, and We had surrounded both with date-palms and had put<br>
between them tillage.<br>
33. Each of the gardens gave its fruit and withheld naught thereof. And We<br>
caused a river to gush forth therein.<br>
34. And he had fruit. And he said unto his comrade, when he spake with him: I am<br>
more than thee in wealth, and stronger in respect of men.<br>
35. And he went into his garden, while he [thus] wronged himself. He said: I<br>
think not that all this will ever perish.<br>
36. I think not that the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back<br>
unto my Lord I surely shall find better than this as a resort.<br>
37. His comrade, when he [thus] spake with him, exclaimed: Disbelievest thou in<br>
Him Who created thee of dust, then of a drop [of seed], and then fashioned thee<br>
a man?<br>
38. But He is Allah, my Lord, and I ascribe unto my Lord no partner.<br>
39. If only, when thou enteredst thy garden, thou hadst said: That which Allah<br>
willeth [will come to pass]! There is no strength save in Allah! Though thou<br>
seest me as less than thee in wealth and children,<br>
40. Yet it may be that my Lord will give me better than thy garden, and will<br>
send on it a bolt from heaven, and some morning it will be a smooth hillside,<br>
41. Or some morning the water thereof will be lost in the earth so that thou<br>
canst not make search for it.<br>
134<br>
<br>
42. And his fruit was beset [with destruction]. Then began he to wring his hands<br>
for all that he had spent upon it, when [now] it was all ruined on its<br>
trellises, and to say: Would that I had ascribed no partner to my Lord!<br>
43. And he had no troop of men to help him as against Allah, nor could he save<br>
himself.<br>
44. In this case is protection only from Allah, the True, He is Best for reward,<br>
and best for consequence.<br>
45. And coin for them the similitude of the life of the world as water which We<br>
send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingleth with it and<br>
then becometh dry twigs that the winds scatter. Allah is able to do all things.<br>
46. Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of the world. But the good<br>
deeds which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better in<br>
respect of hope.<br>
47. And [bethink you of] the Day when we remove the hills and ye see the earth<br>
emerging, and We gather them together so as to leave not one of them behind.<br>
48. And they are set before thy Lord in ranks [and it is said unto them]: Now<br>
verily have ye come unto Us as We created you at the first. But ye thought that<br>
We had set no tryst for you.<br>
49. And the Book is placed, and thou seest the guilty fearful of that which is<br>
therein, and they say: What kind of a Book is this that leaveth not a small<br>
thing nor a great thing but hath counted it! And they find all that they did<br>
confronting them, and thy Lord wrongeth no-one.<br>
50. And [remember] when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam, and<br>
they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He was of the jinn, so he rebelled against<br>
his Lord's command. Will ye choose him and his seed for your protecting friends<br>
instead of Me, when they are an enemy unto you? Calamitous is the exchange for<br>
evil-doers.<br>
51. I made them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor<br>
their own creation; nor choose I misleaders for [My] helpers.<br>
52. And [be mindful of] the Day when He will say: Call those partners of Mine<br>
whom ye pretended. Then they will cry unto them, but they will not hear their<br>
prayer, and We shall set a gulf of doom between them.<br>
53. And the guilty behold the Fire and know that they are about to fall therein,<br>
and they find no way of escape thence.<br>
54. And verily We have displayed for mankind in this Qur'an all manner of<br>
similitudes, but man is more than anything contentious.<br>
55. And naught hindereth mankind from believing when the guidance cometh unto<br>
them, and from asking forgiveness of their Lord unless [it be that they wish]<br>
that the judgment of the men of old should come upon them or [that] they should<br>
be confronted with the Doom.<br>
56. We send not the messengers save as bearers of good news and warners. Those<br>
who disbelieve contend with falsehood in order to refute the Truth thereby. And<br>
they take Our revelations and that wherewith they are threatened as a jest.<br>
57. And who doth greater wrong than he who hath been reminded of the revelations<br>
of his Lord, yet turneth away from them and forgetteth what his hands send<br>
forward [to the Judgment]? Lo! on their hearts We have placed coverings so that<br>
they understand not, and in their ears a deafness. And though thou call them to<br>
the guidance, in that case they can never be led aright.<br>
<br>
135<br>
<br>
58. Thy Lord is the Forgiver, Full of Mercy. If He took them to task [now] for<br>
what they earn, He would hasten on the doom for them; but theirs is an appointed<br>
term from which they will find no escape.<br>
59. And [all] those townships! We destroyed them when they did wrong, and We<br>
appointed a fixed time for their destruction.<br>
60. And when Moses said unto his servant: I will not give up until I reach the<br>
point where the two rivers meet, though I march on for ages.<br>
61. And when they reached the point where the two met, they forgot their fish,<br>
and it took its way into the waters, being free.<br>
62. And when they had gone further, he said unto his servant: Bring us our<br>
breakfast. Verily we have found fatigue in this our journey.<br>
63. He said: Didst thou see, when we took refuge on the rock, and I forgot the<br>
fish - and none but Satan caused me to forget to mention it - it took its way<br>
into the waters by a marvel.<br>
64. He said: This is that which we have been seeking. So they retraced their<br>
steps again.<br>
65. Then found they one of Our slaves, unto whom We had given mercy from Us, and<br>
had taught him knowledge from Our presence.<br>
66. Moses said unto him: May I follow thee, to the end that thou mayst teach me<br>
right conduct of that which thou hast been taught?<br>
67. He said: Lo! thou canst not bear with me.<br>
68. How canst thou bear with that whereof thou canst not compass any knowledge?<br>
69. He said: Allah willing, thou shalt find me patient and I shall not in aught<br>
gainsay thee.<br>
70. He said: Well, if thou go with me, ask me not concerning aught till I myself<br>
make mention of it unto thee.<br>
71. So they twain set out till, when they were in the ship, he made a hole<br>
therein. [Moses] said: Hast thou made a hole therein to drown the folk thereof?<br>
Thou verily hast done a dreadful thing.<br>
72. He said: Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me?<br>
73. [Moses] said: Be not wroth with me that I forgot, and be not hard upon me<br>
for my fault.<br>
74. So they twain journeyed on till, when they met a lad, he slew him. [Moses]<br>
said: What! Hast thou slain an innocent soul who hath slain no man? Verily thou<br>
hast done a horrid thing.<br>
75. He said: Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me?<br>
76. [Moses] said: If I ask thee after this concerning aught, keep not company<br>
with me. Thou hast received an excuse from me.<br>
77. So they twain journeyed on till, when they came unto the folk of a certain<br>
township, they asked its folk for food, but they refused to make them guests.<br>
And they found therein a wall upon the point of falling into ruin, and he<br>
repaired it. [Moses] said: If thou hadst wished, thou couldst have taken payment<br>
for it.<br>
78. He said: This is the parting between thee and me! I will announce unto thee<br>
the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear with patience.<br>
<br>
136<br>
<br>
79. As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working on the river, and I<br>
wished to mar it, for there was a king behind them who is taking every ship by<br>
force.<br>
80. And as for the lad, his parents were believers and we feared lest he should<br>
oppress them by rebellion and disbelief.<br>
81. And we intended that their Lord should change him for them for one better in<br>
purity and nearer to mercy.<br>
82. And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there<br>
was beneath it a treasure belonging to them, and their father had been<br>
righteous, and thy Lord intended that they should come to their full strength<br>
and should bring forth their treasure as a mercy from their Lord; and I did it<br>
not upon my own command. Such is the interpretation of that wherewith thou<br>
couldst not bear.<br>
83. They will ask thee of Dhu'l-Qarneyn. Say: I shall recite unto you a<br>
remembrance of him.<br>
84. Lo! We made him strong in the land and gave him unto every thing a road.<br>
85. And he followed a road<br>
86. Till, when he reached the setting-place of the sun, he found it setting in a<br>
muddy spring, and found a people thereabout. We said: O Dhu'l-Qarneyn! Either<br>
punish or show them kindness.<br>
87. He said: As for him who doeth wrong, we shall punish him, and then he will<br>
be brought back unto his Lord, Who will punish him with awful punishment!<br>
88. But as for him who believeth and doeth right, good will be his reward, and<br>
We shall speak unto him a mild command.<br>
89. Then he followed a road<br>
90. Till, when he reached the rising-place of the sun, he found it rising on a<br>
people for whom We had appointed no shelter therefrom.<br>
91. So [it was]. And We knew all concerning him.<br>
92. Then he followed a road<br>
93. Till, when he came between the two mountains, he found upon their hither<br>
side a folk that scarce could understand a saying.<br>
94. They said: O Dhu'l-Qarneyn! Lo! Gog and Magog are spoiling the land. So may<br>
we pay thee tribute on condition that thou set a barrier between us and them?<br>
95. He said: That wherein my Lord hath established me is better [than your<br>
tribute]. Do but help me with strength [of men], I will set between you and them<br>
a bank.<br>
96. Give me pieces of iron - till, when he had levelled up [the gap] between the<br>
cliffs, he said: Blow! - till, when he had made it a fire, he said: Bring me<br>
molten copper to pour thereon.<br>
97. And [Gog and Magog] were not able to surmount, nor could they pierce [it].<br>
98. He said: This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord<br>
cometh to pass, He will lay it low, for the promise of my Lord is true.<br>
99. And on that day we shall let some of them surge against others, and the<br>
Trumpet will be blown. Then We shall gather them together in one gathering.<br>
100. On that day we shall present hell to the disbelievers, plain to view,<br>
<br>
137<br>
<br>
101. Those whose eyes were hoodwinked from My reminder, and who could not bear<br>
to hear.<br>
102. Do the disbelievers reckon that they can choose My bondmen as protecting<br>
friends beside Me? Lo! We have prepared hell as a welcome for the disbelievers.<br>
103. Say: Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers by their works?<br>
104. Those whose effort goeth astray in the life of the world, and yet they<br>
reckon that they do good work.<br>
105. Those are they who disbelieve in the revelations of their Lord and in the<br>
meeting with Him. Therefor their works are vain, and on the Day of Resurrection<br>
We assign no weight to them.<br>
106. That is their reward: hell, because they disbelieved, and made a jest of<br>
Our revelations and Our messengers.<br>
107. Lo! those who believe and do good works, theirs are the Gardens of Paradise<br>
for welcome,<br>
108. Wherein they will abide, with no desire to be removed from thence.<br>
109. Say: Though the sea became ink for the Words of my Lord, verily the sea<br>
would be used up before the words of my Lord were exhausted, even though We<br>
brought the like thereof to help.<br>
110. Say: I am only a mortal like you. My Lord inspireth in me that your Allah<br>
is only One Allah. And whoever hopeth for the meeting with his Lord, let him do<br>
righteous work, and make none sharer of the worship due unto his Lord.<br>
<br>
SURA 19. MARYAM (MARY)<br>
1. Kaf. Ha. Ya. A'in. Sad.<br>
2. A mention of the mercy of thy Lord unto His servant Zachariah.<br>
3. When he cried unto his Lord a cry in secret,<br>
4. Saying: My Lord! Lo! the bones of me wax feeble and my head is shining with<br>
grey hair, and I have never been unblest in prayer to Thee, my Lord.<br>
5. Lo! I fear my kinsfolk after me, since my wife is barren. Oh, give me from<br>
Thy presence a successor<br>
6. Who shall inherit of me and inherit [also] of the house of Jacob. And make<br>
him, my Lord, acceptable [unto Thee].<br>
7. [It was said unto him]: O Zachariah! Lo! We bring thee tidings of a son whose<br>
name is John; we have given the same name to none before [him].<br>
8. He said: My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren and I have<br>
reached infirm old age?<br>
9. He said: So [it will be]. Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me, even as I<br>
created thee before, when thou wast naught.<br>
10. He said: My Lord! Appoint for me some token. He said: Thy token is that<br>
thou, with no bodily defect, shalt not speak unto mankind three nights.<br>
11. Then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary, and signified to<br>
them: Glorify your Lord at break of day and fall of night.<br>
12. [And it was said unto his son]: O John! Hold fast the Scripture. And we gave<br>
him wisdom when a child,<br>
<br>
138<br>
<br>
13. And compassion from Our presence, and purity; and he was devout,<br>
14. And dutiful toward his parents. And he was not arrogant, rebellious.<br>
15. Peace on him the day he was born, and the day he dieth and the day he shall<br>
be raised alive!<br>
16. And make mention of Mary in the Scripture, when she had withdrawn from her<br>
people to a chamber looking East,<br>
17. And had chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent unto her Our Spirit and it<br>
assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man.<br>
18. She said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art<br>
Allah-fearing.<br>
19. He said: I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a<br>
faultless son.<br>
20. She said: How can I have a son when no mortal hath touched me, neither have<br>
I been unchaste?<br>
21. He said: So [it will be]. Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me. And [it will<br>
be] that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it<br>
is a thing ordained.<br>
22. And she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place.<br>
23. And the pangs of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palm-tree. She<br>
said: Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become a thing of naught,<br>
forgotten!<br>
24. Then [one] cried unto her from below her, saying: Grieve not! Thy Lord hath<br>
placed a rivulet beneath thee,<br>
25. And shake the trunk of the palm-tree toward thee, thou wilt cause ripe dates<br>
to fall upon thee.<br>
26. So eat and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say: Lo! I<br>
have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and may not speak this day to any mortal.<br>
27. Then she brought him to her own folk, carrying him. They said: O Mary! Thou<br>
hast come with an amazing thing.<br>
28. O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a<br>
harlot.<br>
29. Then she pointed to him. They said: How can we talk to one who is in the<br>
cradle, a young boy?<br>
30. He spake: Lo! I am the slave of Allah. He hath given me the Scripture and<br>
hath appointed me a Prophet,<br>
31. And hath made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and hath enjoined upon me<br>
prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive,<br>
32. And [hath made me] dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath not made me<br>
arrogant, unblest.<br>
33. Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be<br>
raised alive!<br>
34. Such was Jesus, son of Mary: [this is] a statement of the truth concerning<br>
which they doubt.<br>
<br>
139<br>
<br>
35. It befitteth not [the Majesty of] Allah that He should take unto Himself a<br>
son. Glory be to Him! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and<br>
it is.<br>
36. And lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So serve Him. That is the right<br>
path.<br>
37. The sects among them differ: but woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting<br>
of an awful Day.<br>
38. See and hear them on the Day they come unto Us! yet the evil-doers are today in error manifest.<br>
39. And warn them of the Day of anguish when the case hath been decided. Now<br>
they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not.<br>
40. Lo! We, only We, inherit the earth and all who are thereon, and unto Us they<br>
are returned.<br>
41. And make mention [O Muhammad] in the Scripture of Abraham. Lo! he was a<br>
saint, a prophet.<br>
42. When he said unto his father: O my father! Why worshippest thou that which<br>
heareth not nor seeth, nor can in aught avail thee?<br>
43. O my father! Lo! there hath come unto me of knowledge that which came not<br>
unto thee. So follow me, and I will lead thee on a right path.<br>
44. O my father! Serve not the devil. Lo! the devil is a rebel unto the<br>
Beneficent.<br>
45. O my father! Lo! I fear lest a punishment from the Beneficent overtake thee<br>
so that thou become a comrade of the devil.<br>
46. He said: Rejectest thou my gods, O Abraham? If thou cease not, I shall<br>
surely stone thee. Depart from me a long while!<br>
47. He said: Peace be unto thee! I shall ask forgiveness of my Lord for thee.<br>
Lo! He was ever gracious unto me.<br>
48. I shall withdraw from you and that unto which ye pray beside Allah, and I<br>
shall pray unto my Lord. It may be that, in prayer unto my Lord, I shall not be<br>
unblest.<br>
49. So, when he had withdrawn from them and that which they were worshipping<br>
beside Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob. Each of them We made a prophet.<br>
50. And we gave them of Our mercy, and assigned to them a high and true renown.<br>
51. And make mention in the Scripture of Moses. Lo! he was chosen, and he was a<br>
messenger [of Allah], a prophet.<br>
52. We called him from the right slope of the Mount, and brought him nigh in<br>
communion.<br>
53. And We bestowed upon him of Our mercy his brother Aaron, a prophet<br>
[likewise].<br>
54. And make mention in the Scripture of Ishmael. Lo! he was a keeper of his<br>
promise, and he was a messenger [of Allah], a prophet.<br>
55. He enjoined upon his people worship and almsgiving, and was acceptable in<br>
the sight of his Lord.<br>
56. And make mention in the Scripture of Idris. Lo! he was a saint, a prophet;<br>
57. And We raised him to high station.<br>
<br>
140<br>
<br>
58. These are they unto whom Allah showed favour from among the prophets, of the<br>
seed of Adam and of those whom We carried [in the ship] with Noah, and of the<br>
seed of Abraham and Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose. When<br>
the revelations of the Beneficent were recited unto them, they fell down,<br>
adoring and weeping.<br>
59. Now there hath succeeded them a later generation whom have ruined worship<br>
and have followed lusts. But they will meet deception.<br>
60. Save him who shall repent and believe and do right. Such will enter the<br>
Garden, and they will not be wronged in aught 61. Gardens of Eden, which the Beneficent hath promised to His slaves in the<br>
unseen. Lo! His promise is ever sure of fulfilment 62. They hear therein no idle talk, but only Peace; and therein they have food<br>
for morn and evening.<br>
63. Such is the Garden which We cause the devout among Our bondmen to inherit.<br>
64. We [angels] come not down save by commandment of thy Lord. Unto Him<br>
belongeth all that is before us and all that is behind us and all that is<br>
between those two, and thy Lord was never forgetful 65. Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them! Therefor,<br>
worship thou Him and be thou steadfast in His service. Knowest thou one that can<br>
be named along with Him?<br>
66. And man saith: When I am dead, shall I forsooth be brought forth alive?<br>
67. Doth not man remember that We created him before, when he was naught?<br>
68. And, by thy Lord, verily We shall assemble them and the devils, then We<br>
shall bring them, crouching, around hell.<br>
69. Then We shall pluck out from every sect whichever of them was most stubborn<br>
in rebellion to the Beneficent.<br>
70. And surely We are Best Aware of those most worthy to be burned therein.<br>
71. There is not one of you but shall approach it. That is a fixed ordinance of<br>
thy Lord.<br>
72. Then We shall rescue those who kept from evil, and leave the evil-doers<br>
crouching there.<br>
73. And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, those who disbelieve<br>
say unto those who believe: Which of the two parties [yours or ours] is better<br>
in position, and more imposing as an army?<br>
74. How many a generation have We destroyed before them, who were more imposing<br>
in respect of gear and outward seeming!<br>
75. Say: As for him who is in error, the Beneficent will verily prolong his span<br>
of life until, when they behold that which they were promised, whether it be<br>
punishment [in the world], or the Hour [of doom], they will know who is worse in<br>
position and who is weaker as an army.<br>
76. Allah increaseth in right guidance those who walk aright, and the good deeds<br>
which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better for resort.<br>
77. Hast thou seen him who disbelieveth in Our revelations and saith: Assuredly<br>
I shall be given wealth and children?<br>
78. Hath he perused the Unseen, or hath he made a pact with the Beneficent?<br>
<br>
141<br>
<br>
79. Nay, but We shall record that which he saith and prolong for him a span of<br>
torment.<br>
80. And We shall inherit from him that whereof he spake, and he will come unto<br>
Us, alone [without his wealth and children].<br>
81. And they have chosen [other] gods beside Allah that they may be a power for<br>
them.<br>
82. Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents unto<br>
them.<br>
83. Seest thou not that We have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound<br>
them with confusion?<br>
84. So make no haste against them [O Muhammad]. We do but number unto them a sum<br>
[of days].<br>
85. On the day when We shall gather the righteous unto the Beneficent, a goodly<br>
company.<br>
86. And drive the guilty unto hell, a weary herd,<br>
87. They will have no power of intercession, save him who hath made a covenant<br>
with his Lord.<br>
88. And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son.<br>
89. Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing<br>
90. Whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the<br>
mountains fall in ruins,<br>
91. That ye ascribe unto the Beneficent a son,<br>
92. When it is not meet for [the Majesty of] the Beneficent that He should<br>
choose a son.<br>
93. There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as<br>
a slave.<br>
94. Verily He knoweth them and numbereth them with [right] numbering.<br>
95. And each one of them will come unto Him on the Day of Resurrection, alone.<br>
96. Lo! those who believe and do good works, the Beneficent will appoint for<br>
them love.<br>
97. And We make [this Scripture] easy in thy tongue, [O Muhammad] only that thou<br>
mayst bear good tidings therewith unto those who ward off [evil], and warn<br>
therewith the froward folk.<br>
98. And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! Canst thou<br>
[Muhammad] see a single man of them, or hear from them the slightest sound?<br>
<br>
SURA 20. TA-HA (TA-HA)<br>
1. Ta. Ha.<br>
2. We have not revealed unto thee [Muhammad] this Qur'an that thou shouldst be<br>
distressed,<br>
3. But as a reminder unto him who feareth,<br>
4. A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens,<br>
5. The Beneficent One, Who is established on the Throne.<br>
142<br>
<br>
6. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the<br>
earth, and whatsoever is between them, and whatsoever is beneath the sod.<br>
7. And if thou speakest aloud, then lo! He knoweth the secret [thought] and<br>
[that which is yet] more hidden.<br>
8. Allah! There is no Allah save Him. His are the most beautiful names.<br>
9. Hath there come unto thee the story of Moses?<br>
10. When he saw a fire and said unto his folk: Lo! Wait! I see a fire afar off.<br>
Peradventure I may bring you a brand therefrom or may find guidance at the fire.<br>
11. And when he reached it, he was called by name: O Moses!<br>
12. Lo! I, even I, am thy Lord, So take off thy shoes, for lo! thou art in the<br>
holy valley of Tuwa.<br>
13. And I have chosen thee, so hearken unto that which is inspired.<br>
14. Lo! I, even I, am Allah, There is no Allah save Me. So serve Me and<br>
establish worship for My remembrance.<br>
15. Lo! the Hour is surely coming. But I will to keep it hidden, that every soul<br>
may be rewarded for that which it striveth [to achieve].<br>
16. Therefor, let not him turn thee aside from [the thought of] it who believeth<br>
not therein but followeth his own desire, lest thou perish.<br>
17. And what is that in thy right hand, O Moses?<br>
18. He said: This is my staff whereon I lean, and wherewith I bear down branches<br>
for my sheep, and wherein I find other uses.<br>
19. He said: Cast it down, O Moses!<br>
20. So he cast it down, and lo! it was a serpent, gliding.<br>
21. He said: Grasp it and fear not. We shall return it to its former state.<br>
22. And thrust thy hand within thine armpit, it will come forth white without<br>
hurt. [That will be] another token.<br>
23. That We may show thee [some] of Our greater portents,<br>
24. Go thou unto Pharaoh! Lo! he hath transgressed [the bounds].<br>
25. [Moses] said: My Lord! relieve my mind<br>
26. And ease my task for me;<br>
27. And loose a knot from my tongue,<br>
28. That they may understand my saying.<br>
29. Appoint for me a henchman from my folk,<br>
30. Aaron, my brother.<br>
31. Confirm my strength with him<br>
32. And let him share my task,<br>
33. That we may glorify Thee much<br>
34. And much remember Thee.<br>
35. Lo! Thou art ever Seeing us.<br>
36. He said: Thou art granted thy request, O Moses.<br>
<br>
143<br>
<br>
37. And indeed, another time, already We have shown thee favour,<br>
38. When we inspired in thy mother that which is inspired,<br>
39. Saying: Throw him into the ark, and throw it into the river, then the river<br>
shall throw it on to the bank, and there an enemy to Me and an enemy to him<br>
shall take him. And I endued thee with love from Me that thou mightest be<br>
trained according to My will,<br>
40. When thy sister went and said: Shall I show you one who will nurse him? and<br>
we restored thee to thy mother that her eyes might be refreshed and might not<br>
sorrow. And thou didst kill a man and We delivered thee from great distress, and<br>
tried thee with a heavy trial. And thou didst tarry years among the folk of<br>
Midian. Then camest thou [hither] by [My] providence, O Moses,<br>
41. And I have attached thee to Myself.<br>
42. Go, thou and thy brother, with My tokens, and be not faint in remembrance of<br>
Me.<br>
43. Go, both of you, unto Pharaoh. Lo! he hath transgressed [the bounds].<br>
44. And speak unto him a gentle word, that peradventure he may heed or fear.<br>
45. They said: Our Lord! Lo! we fear that he may be beforehand with us or that<br>
he may play the tyrant.<br>
46. He said: Fear not. Lo! I am with you twain, Hearing and Seeing.<br>
47. So go ye unto him and say: Lo! we are two messengers of thy Lord. So let the<br>
children of Israel go with us, and torment them not. We bring thee a token from<br>
thy Lord. And peace will be for him who followeth right guidance.<br>
48. Lo! it hath been revealed unto us that the doom will be for him who denieth<br>
and turneth away.<br>
49. [Pharaoh] said: Who then is the Lord of you twain, O Moses?<br>
50. He said: Our Lord is He Who gave unto everything its nature, then guided it<br>
aright.<br>
51. He said: What then is the state of the generations of old?<br>
52. He said: The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a Record. My Lord neither<br>
erreth nor forgetteth,<br>
53. Who hath appointed the earth as a bed and hath threaded roads for you<br>
therein and hath sent down water from the sky and thereby We have brought forth<br>
divers kinds of vegetation,<br>
54. [Saying]: Eat ye and feed your cattle. Lo! herein verily are portents for<br>
men of thought.<br>
55. Thereof We created you, and thereunto We return you, and thence We bring you<br>
forth a second time.<br>
56. And We verily did show him all Our tokens, but he denied them and refused.<br>
57. He said: Hast come to drive us out from our land by thy magic, O Moses?<br>
58. But we surely can produce for thee magic the like thereof; so appoint a<br>
tryst between us and you, which neither we nor thou shall fail to keep, at a<br>
place convenient [to us both].<br>
59. [Moses] said: Your tryst shall be the day of the feast, and let the people<br>
assemble when the sun hath risen high.<br>
<br>
144<br>
<br>
60. Then Pharaoh went and gathered his strength, then came [to the appointed<br>
tryst].<br>
61. Moses said unto them: Woe unto you! Invent not a lie against Allah, lest He<br>
extirpate you by some punishment. He who lieth faileth miserably.<br>
62. Then they debated one with another what they must do, and they kept their<br>
counsel secret.<br>
63. They said: Lo! these are two wizards who would drive you out from your<br>
country by their magic, and destroy your best traditions;<br>
64. So arrange your plan, and come in battle line. Whoso is uppermost this day<br>
will be indeed successful.<br>
65. They said: O Moses! Either throw first, or let us be the first to throw?<br>
66. He said: Nay, do ye throw! Then lo! their cords and their staves, by their<br>
magic, appeared to him as though they ran.<br>
67. And Moses conceived a fear in his mind.<br>
68. We said: Fear not! Lo! thou art the higher.<br>
69. Throw that which is in thy right hand! It will eat up that which they have<br>
made. Lo! that which they have made is but a wizard's artifice, and a wizard<br>
shall not be successful to whatever point [of skill] he may attain.<br>
70. Then the wizards were [all] flung down prostrate, crying: We believe in the<br>
Lord of Aaron and Moses.<br>
71. [Pharaoh] said: Ye put faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he is your<br>
chief who taught you magic. Now surely I shall cut off your hands and your feet<br>
alternately, and I shall crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and ye shall<br>
know for certain which of us hath sterner and more lasting punishment.<br>
72. They said: We choose thee not above the clear proofs that have come unto us,<br>
and above Him Who created us. So decree what thou wilt decree. Thou wilt end for<br>
us only this life of the world.<br>
73. Lo! we believe in our Lord, that He may forgive us our sins and the magic<br>
unto which thou didst force us. Allah is better and more lasting.<br>
74. Lo! whoso cometh guilty unto his Lord, verily for him is hell. There he will<br>
neither die nor live.<br>
75. But whoso cometh unto Him a believer, having done good works, for such are<br>
the high stations;<br>
76. Gardens of Eden underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for<br>
ever. That is the reward of him who groweth.<br>
77. And verily We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night and<br>
strike for them a dry path in the sea, fearing not to be overtaken, neither<br>
being afraid [of the sea].<br>
78. Then Pharaoh followed them with his hosts and there covered them that which<br>
did cover them of the sea.<br>
79. And Pharaoh led his folk astray, he did not guide them.<br>
80. O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, and we made a<br>
covenant with you on the holy mountain's side, and sent down on you the manna<br>
and the quails,<br>
<br>
145<br>
<br>
81. [Saying]: Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you, and<br>
transgress not in respect thereof lest My wrath come upon you: and he on whom My<br>
wrath cometh, he is lost indeed.<br>
82. And lo! verily I am Forgiving toward him who repenteth and believeth and<br>
doeth good, and afterward walketh aright.<br>
83. And [it was said]: What hath made thee hasten from thy folk, O Moses?<br>
84. He said: They are close upon my track. I hastened unto Thee, my Lord, that<br>
Thou mightest be well pleased.<br>
85. He said: Lo! We have tried thy folk in thine absence, and As-Samiri hath<br>
misled them.<br>
86. Then Moses went back unto his folk, angry and sad. He said: O my people!<br>
Hath not your Lord promised you a fair promise? Did the time appointed then<br>
appear too long for you, or did ye wish that wrath from your Lord should come<br>
upon you, that ye broke tryst with me?<br>
87. They said: We broke not tryst with thee of our own will, but we were laden<br>
with burdens of ornaments of the folk, then cast them [in the fire], for thus<br>
As-Samiri proposed.<br>
88. Then he produced for them a calf, of saffron hue, which gave forth a lowing<br>
sound. And they cried: This is your god and the god of Moses, but he hath<br>
forgotten.<br>
89. See they not, then, that it returneth no saying unto them and possesseth for<br>
them neither hurt nor use?<br>
90. And Aaron indeed had told them beforehand: O my people! Ye are but being<br>
seduced therewith, for lo! your Lord is the Beneficent, so follow me and obey my<br>
order.<br>
91. They said: We shall by no means cease to be its votaries till Moses return<br>
unto us.<br>
92. He [Moses] said: O Aaron! What held thee back when thou didst see them gone<br>
astray,<br>
93. That thou followedst me not? Hast thou then disobeyed my order?<br>
94. He said: O son of my mother! Clutch not my beard nor my head! I feared lest<br>
thou shouldst say: Thou hast caused division among the Children of Israel, and<br>
hast not waited for my word.<br>
95. [Moses] said: And what hast thou to say, O Samiri?<br>
96. He said: I perceived what they perceive not, so I seized a handful from the<br>
footsteps of the messenger, and then threw it in. Thus my soul commended to me.<br>
97. [Moses] said: Then go! and lo! in this life it is for thee to say: Touch me<br>
not! and lo! there is for thee a tryst thou canst not break. Now look upon thy<br>
god of which thou hast remained a votary. Verily we will burn it and will<br>
scatter its dust over the sea.<br>
98. Your Allah is only Allah, than Whom there is no other Allah. He embraceth<br>
all things in His knowledge.<br>
99. Thus relate We unto thee [Muhammad] some tidings of that which happened of<br>
old, and We have given thee from Our presence a reminder.<br>
100. Whoso turneth away from it, he verily will bear a burden on the Day of<br>
Resurrection,<br>
<br>
146<br>
<br>
101. Abiding under it - an evil burden for them on the Day of Resurrection,<br>
102. The day when the Trumpet is blown. On that day we assemble the guilty<br>
white-eyed [with terror],<br>
103. Murmuring among themselves: Ye have tarried but ten [days].<br>
104. We are Best Aware of what they utter when their best in conduct say: Ye<br>
have tarried but a day.<br>
105. They will ask thee of the mountains [on that day]. Say: My Lord will break<br>
them into scattered dust.<br>
106. And leave it as an empty plain,<br>
107. Wherein thou seest neither curve nor ruggedness.<br>
108. On that day they follow the summoner who deceiveth not, and voices are<br>
hushed for the Beneficent, and thou hearest but a faint murmur.<br>
109. On that day no intercession availeth save [that of] him unto whom the<br>
Beneficent hath given leave and whose word He accepteth.<br>
110. He knoweth [all] that is before them and [all] that is behind them, while<br>
they cannot compass it in knowledge.<br>
111. And faces humble themselves before the Living, the Eternal. And he who<br>
beareth [a burden of] wrongdoing is indeed a failure [on that day].<br>
112. And he who hath done some good works, being a believer, he feareth not<br>
injustice nor begrudging [of his wage].<br>
113. Thus we have revealed it as a Lecture in Arabic, and have displayed therein<br>
certain threats, that peradventure they may keep from evil or that it may cause<br>
them to take heed.<br>
114. Then exalted be Allah, the True King! And hasten not [O Muhammad] with the<br>
Qur'an ere its revelation hath been perfected unto thee, and say: My Lord!<br>
Increase me in knowledge.<br>
115. And verily We made a covenant of old with Adam, but he forgot, and We found<br>
no constancy in him.<br>
116. And when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam, they fell<br>
prostrate [all] save Iblis; he refused.<br>
117. Therefor we said: O Adam! This is an enemy unto thee and unto thy wife, so<br>
let him not drive you both out of the Garden so that thou come to toil.<br>
118. It is [vouchsafed] unto thee that thou hungerest not therein nor art naked,<br>
119. And that thou thirstest not therein nor art exposed to the sun's heat.<br>
120. But the devil whispered to him, saying: O Adam! Shall I show thee the tree<br>
of immortality and power that wasteth not away?<br>
121. Then they twain ate thereof, so that their shame became apparent unto them,<br>
and they began to hide by heaping on themselves some of the leaves of the<br>
Garden. And Adam disobeyed his Lord, so went astray.<br>
122. Then his Lord chose him, and relented toward him, and guided him.<br>
123. He said: Go down hence, both of you, one of you a foe unto the other. But<br>
when there come unto you from Me a guidance, then whoso followeth My guidance,<br>
he will not go astray nor come to grief.<br>
124. But he who turneth away from remembrance of Me, his will be a narrow life,<br>
and I shall bring him blind to the assembly on the Day of Resurrection.<br>
147<br>
<br>
125. He will say: My Lord! Wherefor hast Thou gathered me [hither] blind, when I<br>
was wont to see?<br>
126. He will say: So [it must be]. Our revelations came unto thee but thou didst<br>
forget them. In like manner thou art forgotten this Day.<br>
127. Thus do We reward him who is prodigal and believeth not the revelations of<br>
his Lord; and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be sterner and more lasting.<br>
128. Is it not a guidance for them [to know] how many a generation We destroyed<br>
before them, amid whose dwellings they walk? Lo! therein verily are signs for<br>
men of thought.<br>
129. And but for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Lord, and a term<br>
already fixed, the judgment would have been inevitable [in this world].<br>
130. Therefor [O Muhammad], bear with what they say, and celebrate the praise of<br>
thy Lord ere the rising of the sun and ere the going down thereof. And glorify<br>
Him some hours of the night and at the two ends of the day, that thou mayst find<br>
acceptance.<br>
131. And strain not thine eyes toward that which We cause some wedded pairs<br>
among them to enjoy, the flower of the life of the world, that We may try them<br>
thereby. The provision of thy Lord is better and more lasting.<br>
132. And enjoin upon thy people worship, and be constant therein. We ask not of<br>
thee a provision: We provided for thee. And the sequel is for righteousness.<br>
133. And they say: If only he would bring us a miracle from his Lord! Hath there<br>
not come unto them the proof of what is in the former scriptures?<br>
134. And if we had destroyed them with some punishment before it, they would<br>
assuredly have said: Our Lord! If only Thou hadst sent unto us a messenger, so<br>
that we might have followed Thy revelations before we were [thus] humbled and<br>
disgraced!<br>
135. Say: Each is awaiting; so await ye! Ye will come to know who are the owners<br>
of the path of equity, and who is right.<br>
<br>
SURA 21. AL-ANBIYA (THE PROPHETS)<br>
1. Their reckoning draweth nigh for mankind, while they turn away in<br>
heedlessness.<br>
2. Never cometh there unto them a new reminder from their Lord but they listen<br>
to it while they play,<br>
3. With hearts preoccupied. And they confer in secret. The wrong-doers say: Is<br>
this other than a mortal like you? Will ye then succumb to magic when ye see<br>
[it]?<br>
4. He saith: My Lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and the earth. He is<br>
the Hearer, the Knower.<br>
5. Nay, say they, [these are but] muddled dreams; nay, he hath but invented it;<br>
nay, he is but a poet. Let him bring us a portent even as those of old [who were<br>
Allah's messengers] were sent [with portents].<br>
6. Not a township believed of those which We destroyed before them [though We<br>
sent them portents]: would they then believe?<br>
7. And We sent not [as Our messengers] before thee other than men, whom We<br>
inspired. Ask the followers of the Reminder if ye know not?<br>
<br>
148<br>
<br>
8. We gave them not bodies that would not eat food, nor were they immortals.<br>
9. Then we fulfilled the promise unto them. So we delivered them and whom We<br>
would, and We destroyed the prodigals.<br>
10. Now We have revealed unto you a Scripture wherein is your Reminder. Have ye<br>
then no sense?<br>
11. How many a community that dealt unjustly have We shattered, and raised up<br>
after them another folk!<br>
12. And, when they felt Our might, behold them fleeing from it!<br>
13. [But it was said unto them]: Flee not, but return to that [existence] which<br>
emasculated you and to your dwellings, that ye may be questioned.<br>
14. They cried: Alas for us! we were wrong-doers.<br>
15. And this their crying ceased not till We made them as reaped corn, extinct.<br>
16. We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in<br>
play.<br>
17. If We had wished to find a pastime, We could have found it in Our presence if We ever did.<br>
18. Nay, but We hurl the true against the false, and it doth break its head and<br>
lo! it vanisheth. And yours will be woe for that which ye ascribe [unto Him].<br>
19. Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who<br>
dwell in His presence are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they weary;<br>
20. They glorify [Him] night and day; they flag not.<br>
21. Or have they chosen gods from the earth who raise the dead?<br>
22. If there were therein gods beside Allah, then verily both [the heavens and<br>
the earth] had been disordered. Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the Throne, from<br>
all that they ascribe [unto Him].<br>
23. He will not be questioned as to that which He doeth, but they will be<br>
questioned.<br>
24. Or have they chosen other gods beside Him? say: Bring your proof [of their<br>
godhead]. This is the Reminder of those with me and those before me, but most of<br>
them know not the Truth and so they are averse.<br>
25. And We sent no messenger before thee but We inspired him, [saying]: There is<br>
no Allah save Me [Allah], so worship Me.<br>
26. And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He Glorified!<br>
Nay, but [those whom they call sons] are honoured slaves;<br>
27. They speak not until He hath spoken, and they act by His command.<br>
28. He knoweth what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot<br>
intercede except for him whom He accepteth, and they quake for awe of Him.<br>
29. And one of them who should say: Lo! I am a god beside Him, that one We<br>
should repay with hell. Thus We Repay wrong-doers.<br>
30. Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of<br>
one piece, then We parted them, and we made every living thing of water? Will<br>
they not then believe?<br>
31. And We have placed in the earth firm hills lest it quake with them, and We<br>
have placed therein ravines as roads that haply they may find their way.<br>
<br>
149<br>
<br>
32. And we have made the sky a roof withheld [from them]. Yet they turn away<br>
from its portents.<br>
33. And He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon.<br>
They float, each in an orbit.<br>
34. We appointed immortality for no mortal before thee. What! if thou diest, can<br>
they be immortal!<br>
35. Every soul must taste of death, and We try you with evil and with good, for<br>
ordeal. And unto Us ye will be returned.<br>
36. And when those who disbelieve behold thee, they but choose thee out for<br>
mockery, [saying]: Is this he who maketh mention of your gods? And they would<br>
deny all mention of the Beneficent.<br>
37. Man is made of haste. I shall show you My portents, but ask Me not to<br>
hasten.<br>
38. And they say: When will this promise [be fulfilled], if ye are truthful?<br>
39. If those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not be able to<br>
drive off the fire from their faces and from their backs, and they will not be<br>
helped!<br>
40. Nay, but it will come upon them unawares so that it will stupefy them, and<br>
they will be unable to repel it, neither will they be reprieved.<br>
41. Messengers before thee, indeed, were mocked, but that whereat they mocked<br>
surrounded those who scoffed at them.<br>
42. Say: Who guardeth you in the night or in the day from the Beneficent? Nay,<br>
but they turn away from mention of their Lord!<br>
43. Or have they gods who can shield them from Us? They cannot help themselves<br>
nor can they be defended from Us.<br>
44. Nay, but We gave these and their fathers ease until life grew long for them.<br>
See they not how we aim to the land, reducing it of its outlying parts? Can they<br>
then be the victors?<br>
45. Say [O Muhammad, unto mankind]: I warn you only by the Inspiration. But the<br>
deaf hear not the call when they are warned.<br>
46. And if a breath of thy Lord's punishment were to touch them, they assuredly<br>
would say: Alas for us! Lo! we were wrong-doers.<br>
47. And We set a just balance for the Day of Resurrection so that no soul is<br>
wronged in aught. Though it be of the weight of a grain of mustard seed, We<br>
bring it. And We suffice for reckoners.<br>
48. And We verily gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion [of right and wrong] and a<br>
light and a Reminder for those who keep from evil,<br>
49. Those who fear their Lord in secret and who dread the Hour [of doom].<br>
50. This is a blessed Reminder that we have revealed: Will ye then reject it?<br>
51. And We verily gave Abraham of old his proper course, and We were Aware of<br>
him,<br>
52. When he said unto his father and his folk: What are these images unto which<br>
ye pay devotion?<br>
53. They said: We found our fathers worshippers of them.<br>
54. He said: Verily ye and your fathers were in plain error.<br>
<br>
150<br>
<br>
55. They said: Bringest thou unto us the truth, or art thou some jester?<br>
56. He said: Nay, but your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who<br>
created them; and I am of those who testify unto that.<br>
57. And, by Allah, I shall circumvent your idols after ye have gone away and<br>
turned your backs.<br>
58. Then he reduced them to fragments, all save the chief of them, that haply<br>
they might have recourse to it.<br>
59. They said: Who hath done this to our gods? Surely it must be some evil-doer.<br>
60. They said: We heard a youth make mention of them, who is called Abraham.<br>
61. They said: Then bring him [hither] before the people's eyes that they may<br>
testify.<br>
62. They said: Is it thou who hast done this to our gods, O Abraham?<br>
63. He said: But this, their chief hath done it. So question them, if they can<br>
speak.<br>
64. Then gathered they apart and said: Lo! ye yourselves are the wrong-doers.<br>
65. And they were utterly confounded, and they said: Well thou knowest that<br>
these speak not.<br>
66. He said: Worship ye then instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at<br>
all, nor harm you?<br>
67. Fie on you and all that ye worship instead of Allah! Have ye then no sense?<br>
68. They cried: Burn him and stand by your gods, if ye will be doing.<br>
69. We said: O fire, be coolness and peace for Abraham,<br>
70. And they wished to set a snare for him, but We made them the greater losers.<br>
71. And We rescued him and Lot [and brought them] to the land which We have<br>
blessed for [all] peoples.<br>
72. And We bestowed upon him Isaac, and Jacob as a grandson. Each of them We<br>
made righteous.<br>
73. And We made them chiefs who guide by Our command, and We inspired in them<br>
the doing of good deeds and the right establishment of worship and the giving of<br>
alms, and they were worshippers of Us [alone].<br>
74. And unto Lot we gave judgment and knowledge, and We delivered him from the<br>
community that did abominations. Lo! they were folk of evil, lewd.<br>
75. And We brought him in unto Our mercy. Lo! he was of the righteous.<br>
76. And Noah, when he cried of old, We heard his prayer and saved him and his<br>
household from the great affliction.<br>
77. And delivered him from the people who denied Our revelations. Lo! they were<br>
folk of evil, therefor did We drown them all.<br>
78. And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment concerning the field, when<br>
people's sheep had strayed and browsed therein by night; and We were witnesses<br>
to their judgment.<br>
79. And We made Solomon to understand [the case]; and unto each of them We gave<br>
judgment and knowledge. And we subdued the hills and the birds to hymn [His]<br>
praise along with David. We were the doers [thereof].<br>
<br>
151<br>
<br>
80. And We taught him the art of making garments [of mail] to protect you in<br>
your daring. Are ye then thankful?<br>
81. And unto Solomon [We subdued] the wind in its raging. It set by his command<br>
toward the land which We had blessed. And of everything We are Aware.<br>
82. And of the evil ones [subdued We unto him] some who dived [for pearls] for<br>
him and did other work, and We were warders unto them.<br>
83. And Job, when he cried unto his Lord, [saying]: Lo! adversity afflicteth me,<br>
and Thou art Most Merciful of all who show mercy.<br>
84. Then We heard his prayer and removed that adversity from which he suffered,<br>
and We gave him his household [that he had lost] and the like thereof along with<br>
them, a mercy from Our store, and a remembrance for the worshippers;<br>
85. And [mention] Ishmael, and Idris, and Dhu'l-Kifl. All were of the steadfast.<br>
86. And We brought them in unto Our mercy. Lo! they are among the righteous.<br>
87. And [mention] Dhu'n-Nun, when he went off in anger and deemed that We had no<br>
power over him, but he cried out in the darkness, saying: There is no Allah save<br>
Thee. Be Thou Glorified! Lo! I have been a wrong-doer.<br>
88. Then we heard his prayer and saved him from the anguish. Thus we save<br>
believers.<br>
89. And Zachariah, when he cried unto his Lord: My Lord! Leave me not childless,<br>
though Thou art the Best of inheritors.<br>
90. Then We heard his prayer, and bestowed upon him John, and adjusted his wife<br>
[to bear a child] for him. Lo! they used to vie one with the other in good<br>
deeds, and they cried unto Us in longing and in fear, and were submissive unto<br>
Us.<br>
91. And she who was chaste, therefor We breathed into her [something] of Our<br>
Spirit and made her and her son a token for [all] peoples.<br>
92. Lo! this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me.<br>
93. And they have broken their religion [into fragments] among them, [yet] all<br>
are returning unto Us.<br>
94. Then whoso doeth some good works and is a believer, there will be no<br>
rejection of his effort. Lo! We record [it] for him.<br>
95. And there is a ban upon any community which We have destroyed: that they<br>
shall not return.<br>
96. Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, and they hasten out of every mound,<br>
97. And the True Promise draweth nigh; then behold them, staring wide [in<br>
terror], the eyes of those who disbelieve! [They say]: Alas for us! We [lived]<br>
in forgetfulness of this. Ah, but we were wrong-doers!<br>
98. Lo! ye [idolaters] and that which ye worship beside Allah are fuel of hell.<br>
Thereunto ye will come.<br>
99. If these had been gods they would not have come thither, but all will abide<br>
therein.<br>
100. Therein wailing is their portion, and therein they hear not.<br>
101. Lo! those unto whom kindness hath gone forth before from Us, they will be<br>
far removed from thence.<br>
<br>
152<br>
<br>
102. They will not hear the slightest sound thereof, while they abide in that<br>
which their souls desire.<br>
103. The Supreme Horror will not grieve them, and the angels will welcome them,<br>
[saying]: This is your Day which ye were promised;<br>
104. The Day when We shall roll up the heavens as a recorder rolleth up a<br>
written scroll. As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. [It is] a<br>
promise [binding] upon Us. Lo! We are to perform it.<br>
105. And verily we have written in the Scripture, after the Reminder: My<br>
righteous slaves will inherit the earth:<br>
106. Lo! there is a plain statement for folk who are devout.<br>
107. We sent thee not save as a mercy for the peoples.<br>
108. Say: It is only inspired in me that your Allah is One Allah. Will ye then<br>
surrender [unto Him]?<br>
109. But if they are averse, then say: I have warned you all alike, although I<br>
know not whether nigh or far is that which ye are promised.<br>
110. Lo! He knoweth that which is said openly, and that which ye conceal.<br>
111. And I know not but that this may be a trial for you, and enjoyment for a<br>
while.<br>
112. He saith: My Lord! Judge Thou with truth. Our Lord is the Beneficent, Whose<br>
help is to be implored against that which ye ascribe [unto Him].<br>
<br>
SURA 22. AL-HAJJ (THE PILGRIMAGE)<br>
1. O mankind! Fear your Lord. Lo! the earthquake of the Hour [of Doom] is a<br>
tremendous thing.<br>
2. On the day when ye behold it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling<br>
and every pregnant one will be delivered of her burden, and thou [Muhammad] wilt<br>
see mankind as drunken, yet they will not be drunken, but the Doom of Allah will<br>
be strong [upon them].<br>
3. Among mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah without knowledge, and<br>
followeth each froward devil;<br>
4. For him it is decreed that whoso taketh him for friend, he verily will<br>
mislead him and will guide him to the punishment of the Flame.<br>
5. O mankind! if ye are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then lo! We have<br>
created you from dust, then from a drop of seed, then from a clot, then from a<br>
little lump of flesh shapely and shapeless, that We may make [it] clear for you.<br>
And We cause what We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed time, and<br>
afterward We bring you forth as infants, then [give you growth] that ye attain<br>
your full strength. And among you there is he who dieth [young], and among you<br>
there is he who is brought back to the most abject time of life, so that, after<br>
knowledge, he knoweth naught. And thou [Muhammad] seest the earth barren, but<br>
when We send down water thereon, it doth thrill and swell and put forth every<br>
lovely kind [of growth].<br>
6. That is because Allah, He is the Truth and because He quickeneth the dead,<br>
and because He is Able to do all things;<br>
7. And because the Hour will come, there is no doubt thereof; and because Allah<br>
will raise those who are in the graves.<br>
<br>
153<br>
<br>
8. And among mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah without knowledge or<br>
guidance or a scripture giving light,<br>
9. Turning away in pride to beguile [men] from the way of Allah. For him in this<br>
world is ignominy, and on the Day of Resurrection We make him taste the doom of<br>
burning.<br>
10. [And unto him it will be said]: This is for that which thy two hands have<br>
sent before, and because Allah is no oppressor of His slaves.<br>
11. And among mankind is he who worshippeth Allah upon a narrow marge so that if<br>
good befalleth him he is content therewith, but if a trial befalleth him, he<br>
falleth away utterly. He loseth both the world and the Hereafter. That is the<br>
sheer loss.<br>
12. He calleth, beside Allah, unto that which hurteth him not nor benefiteth<br>
him. That is the far error.<br>
13. He calleth unto him whose harm is nearer than his benefit; verily an evil<br>
patron and verily an evil friend!<br>
14. Lo! Allah causeth those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens<br>
underneath which rivers flow. Lo! Allah doth what He intendeth.<br>
15. Whoso is wont to think [through envy] that Allah will not give him<br>
[Muhammad] victory in the world and the Hereafter [and is enraged at the thought<br>
of his victory], let him stretch a rope up to the roof [of his dwelling], and<br>
let him hang himself. Then let him see whether his strategy dispelleth that<br>
whereat he rageth!.<br>
16. Thus We reveal it as plain revelations, and verily Allah guideth whom He<br>
will.<br>
17. Lo! those who believe [this revelation], and those who are Jews, and the<br>
Sabaeans and the Christians and the Magians and the idolaters - Lo! Allah will<br>
decide between them on the Day of Resurrection. Lo! Allah is Witness over all<br>
things.<br>
18. Hast thou not seen that unto Allah payeth adoration whosoever is in the<br>
heavens and whosoever is in the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars,<br>
and the hills, and the trees, and the beasts, and many of mankind, while there<br>
are many unto whom the doom is justly due. He whom Allah scorneth, there is none<br>
to give him honour. Lo! Allah doeth what He will.<br>
19. These twain [the believers and the disbelievers] are two opponents who<br>
contend concerning their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, garments of fire<br>
will be cut out for them; boiling fluid will be poured down on their heads,<br>
20. Whereby that which is in their bellies, and their skins too, will be melted;<br>
21. And for them are hooked rods of iron.<br>
22. Whenever, in their anguish, they would go forth from thence they are driven<br>
back therein and [it is said unto them]: Taste the doom of burning.<br>
23. Lo! Allah will cause those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens<br>
underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will be allowed armlets of gold, and<br>
pearls, and their raiment therein will be silk.<br>
24. They are guided unto gentle speech; they are guided unto the path of the<br>
Glorious One.<br>
25. Lo! those who disbelieve and bar [men] from the way of Allah and from the<br>
Inviolable Place of Worship, which We have appointed for mankind together, the<br>
<br>
154<br>
<br>
dweller therein and the nomad: whosoever seeketh wrongful partiality therein,<br>
him We shall cause to taste a painful doom.<br>
26. And [remember] when We prepared for Abraham the place of the [holy] House,<br>
saying: Ascribe thou no thing as partner unto Me, and purify My House for those<br>
who make the round [thereof] and those who stand and those who bow and make<br>
prostration.<br>
27. And proclaim unto mankind the pilgrimage. They will come unto thee on foot<br>
and on every lean camel; they will come from every deep ravine,<br>
28. That they may witness things that are of benefit to them, and mention the<br>
name of Allah on appointed days over the beast of cattle that He hath bestowed<br>
upon them. Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor unfortunate.<br>
29. Then let them make an end of their unkemptness and pay their vows and go<br>
around the ancient House.<br>
30. That [is the command]. And whoso magnifieth the sacred things of Allah, it<br>
will be well for him in the sight of his Lord. The cattle are lawful unto you<br>
save that which hath been told you. So shun the filth of idols, and shun lying<br>
speech,<br>
31. Turning unto Allah [only], not ascribing partners unto Him; for whoso<br>
ascribeth partners unto Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky and the<br>
birds had snatched him or the wind had blown him to a far-off place.<br>
32. That [is the command]. And whoso magnifieth the offerings consecrated to<br>
Allah, it surely is from devotion of the hearts,<br>
33. Therein are benefits for you for an appointed term; and afterward they are<br>
brought for sacrifice unto the ancient House.<br>
34. And for every nation have We appointed a ritual, that they may mention the<br>
name of Allah over the beast of cattle that He hath given them for food; and<br>
your god is One God, therefor surrender unto Him. And give good tidings [O<br>
Muhammad] to the humble,<br>
35. Whose hearts fear when Allah is mentioned, and the patient of whatever may<br>
befall them, and those who establish worship and who spend of that We have<br>
bestowed on them.<br>
36. And the camels! We have appointed them among the ceremonies of Allah.<br>
Therein ye have much good. So mention the name of Allah over them when they are<br>
drawn up in lines. Then when their flanks fall [dead], eat thereof and feed the<br>
beggar and the suppliant. Thus have We made them subject unto you, that haply ye<br>
may give thanks.<br>
37. Their flesh and their food reach not Allah, but the devotion from you<br>
reacheth Him. Thus have We made them subject unto you that ye may magnify Allah<br>
that He hath guided you. And give good tidings [O Muhammad] to the good.<br>
38. Lo! Allah defendeth those who are true. Lo! Allah loveth not each<br>
treacherous ingrate.<br>
39. Sanction is given unto those who fight because they have been wronged; and<br>
Allah is indeed Able to give them victory;<br>
40. Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said:<br>
Our Lord is Allah - For had it not been for Allah's repelling some men by means<br>
of others, cloisters and churches and oratories and mosques, wherein the name of<br>
Allah is oft mentioned, would assuredly have been pulled down. Verily Allah<br>
helpeth one who helpeth Him. Lo! Allah is Strong, Almighty -<br>
<br>
155<br>
<br>
41. Those who, if We give them power in the land, establish worship and pay the<br>
poor-due and enjoin kindness and forbid iniquity. And Allah's is the sequel of<br>
events.<br>
42. If they deny thee [Muhammad], even so the folk of Noah, and [the tribes of]<br>
A'ad and Thamud, before thee, denied [Our messengers];<br>
43. And the folk of Abraham and the folk of Lot;<br>
44. [And] the dwellers in Midian. And Moses was denied; but I indulged the<br>
disbelievers a long while, then I seized them, and how [terrible] was My<br>
abhorrence!<br>
45. How many a township have We destroyed while it was sinful, so that it lieth<br>
[to this day] in ruins, and [how many] a deserted well and lofty tower!<br>
46. Have they not travelled in the land, and have they hearts wherewith to feel<br>
and ears wherewith to hear? For indeed it is not the eyes that grow blind, but<br>
it is the hearts, which are within the bosoms, that grow blind.<br>
47. And they will bid thee hasten on the Doom, and Allah faileth not His<br>
promise, but lo! a Day with Allah is as a thousand years of what ye reckon.<br>
48. And how many a township did I suffer long though it was sinful! Then I<br>
grasped it. Unto Me is the return.<br>
49. Say: O mankind! I am only a plain warner unto you.<br>
50. Those who believe and do good works, for them is pardon and a rich<br>
provision;<br>
51. While those who strive to thwart Our revelations, such are rightful owners<br>
of the Fire.<br>
52. Never sent We a messenger or a prophet before thee but when He recited [the<br>
message] Satan proposed [opposition] in respect of that which he recited<br>
thereof. But Allah abolisheth that which Satan proposeth. Then Allah<br>
establisheth His revelations. Allah is Knower, Wise;<br>
53. That He may make that which the devil proposeth a temptation for those in<br>
whose hearts is a disease, and those whose hearts are hardened - Lo! the evildoers are in open schism 54. And that those who have been given knowledge may know that it is the truth<br>
from thy Lord, so that they may believe therein and their hearts may submit<br>
humbly unto Him. Lo! Allah verily is guiding those who believe unto a right<br>
path.<br>
55. And those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt thereof until the<br>
Hour come upon them unawares, or there come unto them the doom of a disastrous<br>
day.<br>
56. The Sovereignty on that day will be Allah's, He will judge between them.<br>
Then those who believed and did good works will be in Gardens of Delight,<br>
57. While those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations, for them will be a<br>
shameful doom.<br>
58. Those who fled their homes for the cause of Allah and then were slain or<br>
died, Allah verily will provide for them a good provision. Lo! Allah, He verily<br>
is Best of all who make provision.<br>
59. Assuredly He will cause them to enter by an entry that they will love. Lo!<br>
Allah verily is Knower, Indulgent.<br>
<br>
156<br>
<br>
60. That [is so]. And whoso hath retaliated with the like of that which he was<br>
made to suffer and then hath [again] been wronged, Allah will succour him. Lo!<br>
Allah verily is Mild, Forgiving.<br>
61. That is because Allah maketh the night to pass into the day and maketh the<br>
day to pass into the night, and because Allah is Hearer, Seer.<br>
62. That is because Allah, He is the True, and that whereon they call instead of<br>
Him, it is the false, and because Allah, He is the High, the Great.<br>
63. Seest thou not how Allah sendeth down water from the sky and then the earth<br>
becometh green upon the morrow? Lo! Allah is Subtile, Aware.<br>
64. Unto Him belongeth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth.<br>
Lo! Allah, He verily is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise.<br>
65. Hast thou not seen how Allah hath made all that is in the earth subservient<br>
unto you? And the ship runneth upon the sea by His command, and He holdeth back<br>
the heaven from falling on the earth unless by His leave. Lo! Allah is, for<br>
mankind, Full of Pity, Merciful.<br>
66. And He it is Who gave you life, then He will cause you to die, and then will<br>
give you life [again]. Lo! man is verily an ingrate.<br>
67. Unto each nation have We given sacred rites which they are to perform; so<br>
let them not dispute with thee of the matter, but summon thou unto thy Lord. Lo!<br>
thou indeed followest right guidance.<br>
68. And if they wrangle with thee, say: Allah is Best Aware of what ye do.<br>
69. Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that<br>
wherein ye used to differ.<br>
70. Hast thou not known that Allah knoweth all that is in the heaven and the<br>
earth? Lo! it is in a record. Lo! that is easy for Allah.<br>
71. And they worship instead of Allah that for which He hath sent down no<br>
warrant, and that whereof they have no knowledge. For evil-doers there is no<br>
helper.<br>
72. And when Our revelations are recited unto them, thou knowest the denial in<br>
the faces of those who disbelieve; they all but attack those who recite Our<br>
revelations unto them. Say: Shall I proclaim unto you worse than that? The Fire!<br>
Allah hath promised it for those who disbelieve. A hapless journey's end!<br>
73. O mankind! A similitude is coined, so pay ye heed to it: Lo! those on whom<br>
ye call beside Allah will never create a fly though they combine together for<br>
the purpose. And if the fly took something from them, they could not rescue it<br>
from it. So weak are [both] the seeker and the sought!<br>
74. They measure not Allah His rightful measure. Lo! Allah is Strong, Almighty.<br>
75. Allah chooseth from the angels messengers, and [also] from mankind. Lo!<br>
Allah is Hearer, Seer.<br>
76. He knoweth all that is before them and all that is behind them, and unto<br>
Allah all things are returned. $$A<br>
77. O ye who believe! Bow down and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord,<br>
and do good, that haply ye may prosper.<br>
78. And strive for Allah with the endeavour which is His right. He hath chosen<br>
you and hath not laid upon you in religion any hardship; the faith of your<br>
father Abraham [is yours]. He hath named you Muslims of old time and in this<br>
[Scripture], that the messenger may be a witness against you, and that ye may be<br>
<br>
157<br>
<br>
witnesses against mankind. So establish worship, pay the poor-due, and hold fast<br>
to Allah. He is your Protecting friend. A blessed Patron and a blessed Helper!<br>
<br>
SURA 23. AL-MUMENOON (THE BELIEVERS)<br>
1. Successful indeed are the believers<br>
2. Who are humble in their prayers,<br>
3. And who shun vain conversation,<br>
4. And who are payers of the poor-due;<br>
5. And who guard their modesty 6. Save from their wives or the [slaves] that their right hands possess, for<br>
then they are not blameworthy,<br>
7. But whoso craveth beyond that, such are transgressors 8. And who are shepherds of their pledge and their covenant,<br>
9. And who pay heed to their prayers.<br>
10. These are the heirs<br>
11. Who will inherit paradise. There they will abide.<br>
12. Verily We created man from a product of wet earth;<br>
13. Then placed him as a drop [of seed] in a safe lodging;<br>
14. Then fashioned We the drop a clot, then fashioned We the clot a little lump,<br>
then fashioned We the little lump bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, and<br>
then produced it as another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators!<br>
15. Then lo! after that ye surely die.<br>
16. Then lo! on the Day of Resurrection ye are raised [again].<br>
17. And We have created above you seven paths, and We are never unmindful of<br>
creation.<br>
18. And we send down from the sky water in measure, and We give it lodging in<br>
the earth, and lo! We are Able to withdraw it.<br>
19. Then We produce for you therewith gardens of date-palms and grapes, wherein<br>
is much fruit for you and whereof ye eat;<br>
20. And a tree that springeth forth from Mount Sinai that groweth oil and relish<br>
for the eaters.<br>
21. And lo! in the cattle there is verily a lesson for you. We give you to drink<br>
of that which is in their bellies, and many uses have ye in them, and of them do<br>
ye eat;<br>
22. And on them and on the ship ye are carried.<br>
23. And We verily sent Noah unto his folk, and he said: O my people! Serve<br>
Allah. Ye have no other Allah save Him. Will ye not ward off [evil]?<br>
24. But the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved, said: This is only a mortal<br>
like you who would make himself superior to you. Had Allah willed, He surely<br>
could have sent down angels. We heard not of this in the case of our fathers of<br>
old.<br>
25. He is only a man in whom is a madness, so watch him for a while.<br>
<br>
158<br>
<br>
26. He said: My Lord! Help me because they deny me.<br>
27. Then We inspired in him, saying: Make the ship under Our eyes and Our<br>
inspiration. Then, when Our command cometh and the oven gusheth water, introduce<br>
therein of every [kind] two spouses, and thy household save him thereof against<br>
whom the Word hath already gone forth. And plead not with Me on behalf of those<br>
who have done wrong. Lo! they will be drowned.<br>
28. And when thou art on board the ship, thou and whoso is with thee, then say:<br>
Praise be to Allah Who hath saved us from the wrongdoing folk!<br>
29. And say: My Lord! Cause me to land at a blessed landing-place, for Thou art<br>
Best of all who bring to land.<br>
30. Lo! herein verily are portents, for lo! We are ever putting [mankind] to the<br>
test.<br>
31. Then, after them, We brought forth another generation;<br>
32. And we sent among them a messenger of their own, saying: Serve Allah, Ye<br>
have no other Allah save Him. Will ye not ward off [evil]?<br>
33. And the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved and denied the meeting of<br>
the Hereafter, and whom We had made soft in the life of the world, said: This is<br>
only a mortal like you, who eateth of that whereof ye eat and drinketh of that<br>
ye drink.<br>
34. If ye were to obey a mortal like yourselves, then, lo! ye surely would be<br>
losers.<br>
35. Doth he promise you that you, when ye are dead and have become dust and<br>
bones, will [again] be brought forth?<br>
36. Begone, begone, with that which ye are promised!<br>
37. There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live, and we shall<br>
not be raised [again].<br>
38. He is only a man who hath invented a lie about Allah. We are not going to<br>
put faith in him.<br>
39. He said: My Lord! Help me because they deny me.<br>
40. He said: In a little while they surely will become repentant.<br>
41. So the [Awful] Cry overtook them rightfully, and We made them like as<br>
wreckage [that a torrent hurleth]. A far removal for wrongdoing folk!<br>
42. Then after them We brought forth other generations.<br>
43. No nation can outstrip its term, nor yet postpone it.<br>
44. Then We sent our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger came<br>
unto a nation they denied him; so We caused them to follow one another [to<br>
disaster] and We made them bywords. A far removal for folk who believe not!<br>
45. Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our tokens and a clear warrant<br>
46. Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they scorned [them] and they were despotic<br>
folk.<br>
47. And they said: Shall we put faith in two mortals like ourselves, and whose<br>
folk are servile unto us?<br>
48. So they denied them, and became of those who were destroyed.<br>
49. And We verily gave Moses the Scripture, that haply they might go aright.<br>
<br>
159<br>
<br>
50. And We made the son of Mary and his mother a portent, and We gave them<br>
refuge on a height, a place of flocks and watersprings.<br>
51. O ye messengers! Eat of the good things, and do right. Lo! I am Aware of<br>
what ye do.<br>
52. And lo! this your religion is one religion and I am your Lord, so keep your<br>
duty unto Me.<br>
53. But they [mankind] have broken their religion among them into sects, each<br>
group rejoicing in its tenets.<br>
54. So leave them in their error till a time.<br>
55. Think they that in the wealth and sons wherewith We provide them<br>
56. We hasten unto them with good things? Nay, but they perceive not.<br>
57. Lo! those who go in awe for fear of their Lord.<br>
58. And those who believe in the revelations of their Lord,<br>
59. And those who ascribe not partners unto their Lord,<br>
60. And those who give that which they give with hearts afraid because they are<br>
about to return unto their Lord,<br>
61. These race for the good things, and they shall win them in the race.<br>
62. And we task not any soul beyond its scope, and with Us is a Record which<br>
speaketh the truth, and they will not be wronged.<br>
63. Nay, but their hearts are in ignorance of this [Qur'an], and they have other<br>
works, besides, which they are doing;<br>
64. Till when We grasp their luxurious ones with the punishment, behold! they<br>
supplicate.<br>
65. Supplicate not this day! Assuredly ye will not be helped by Us.<br>
66. My revelations were recited unto you, but ye used to turn back on your<br>
heels,<br>
67. In scorn thereof. Nightly did ye rave together.<br>
68. Have they not pondered the Word, or hath that come unto them which came not<br>
unto their fathers of old?<br>
69. Or know they not their messenger, and so reject him?<br>
70. Or say they: There is a madness in him? Nay, but he bringeth them the Truth;<br>
and most of them are haters of the Truth.<br>
71. And if the Truth had followed their desires, verily the heavens and the<br>
earth and whosoever is therein had been corrupted. Nay, We have brought them<br>
their Reminder, but from their Reminder they now turn away.<br>
72. Or dost thou ask of them [O Muhammad] any tribute? But the bounty of thy<br>
Lord is better, for He is Best of all who make provision.<br>
73. And lo! thou summonest them indeed unto a straight path.<br>
74. And lo! those who believe not in the Hereafter are indeed astray from the<br>
path.<br>
75. Though We had mercy on them and relieved them of the harm afflicting them,<br>
they still would wander blindly on in their contumacy.<br>
<br>
160<br>
<br>
76. Already have We grasped them with punishment, but they humble not themselves<br>
unto their Lord, nor do they pray,<br>
77. Until, when We open for them the gate of extreme punishment, behold! they<br>
are aghast thereat.<br>
78. He it is Who hath created for you ears and eyes and hearts. Small thanks<br>
give ye!<br>
79. And He it is Who hath sown you broadcast in the earth, and unto Him ye will<br>
be gathered.<br>
80. And He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and His is the difference of<br>
night and day. Have ye then no sense?<br>
81. Nay, but they say the like of that which said the men of old;<br>
82. They say: When we are dead and have become [mere] dust and bones, shall we<br>
then, forsooth, be raised again?<br>
83. We were already promised this, we and our forefathers. Lo! this is naught<br>
but fables of the men of old.<br>
84. Say: Unto Whom [belongeth] the earth and whosoever is therein, if ye have<br>
knowledge?<br>
85. They will say: Unto Allah. Say: Will ye not then remember?<br>
86. Say: Who is Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the Tremendous Throne?<br>
87. They will say: Unto Allah [all that belongeth]. Say: Will ye not then keep<br>
duty [unto Him]?<br>
88. Say: In Whose hand is the dominion over all things and He protecteth, while<br>
against Him there is no protection, if ye have knowledge?<br>
89. They will say: Unto Allah [all that belongeth]. Say: How then are ye<br>
bewitched?<br>
90. Nay, but We have brought them the Truth, and lo! they are liars.<br>
91. Allah hath not chosen any son, nor is there any god along with Him; else<br>
would each god have assuredly championed that which he created, and some of them<br>
would assuredly have overcome others. Glorified be Allah above all that they<br>
allege.<br>
92. Knower of the Invisible and the Visible! and Exalted be He over all that<br>
they ascribe as partners [unto Him]!<br>
93. Say: My Lord! If Thou shouldst show me that which they are promised.<br>
94. My Lord! then set me not among the wrongdoing folk.<br>
95. And verily We are Able to show thee that which We have promised them.<br>
96. Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best Aware of that which they<br>
allege.<br>
97. And say: My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from suggestions of the evil ones,<br>
98. And I seek refuge in Thee, my Lord, lest they be present with me,<br>
99. Until, when death cometh unto one of them, he saith: My Lord! Send me back,<br>
100. That I may do right in that which I have left behind! But nay! It is but a<br>
word that he speaketh; and behind them is a barrier until the day when they are<br>
raised.<br>
<br>
161<br>
<br>
101. And when the trumpet is blown there will be no kinship among them that day,<br>
nor will they ask of one another.<br>
102. Then those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful.<br>
103. And those whose scales are light are those who lose their souls, in hell<br>
abiding.<br>
104. The fire burneth their faces, and they are glum therein.<br>
105. [It will be said]: Were not My revelations recited unto you, and then ye<br>
used to deny them?<br>
106. They will say: Our Lord! Our evil fortune conquered us, and we were erring<br>
folk.<br>
107. Our Lord! Oh, bring us forth from hence! If we return [to evil] then indeed<br>
we shall be wrong-doers.<br>
108. He saith: Begone therein, and speak not unto Me.<br>
109. Lo! there was a party of My slaves who said: Our Lord! We believe, therefor<br>
forgive us and have mercy on us for Thou art Best of all who show mercy;<br>
110. But ye chose them for a laughing-stock until they caused you to forget<br>
remembrance of Me, while ye laughed at them.<br>
111. Lo! I have rewarded them this day forasmuch as they were steadfast in that<br>
they, even they, are the triumphant.<br>
112. He will say: How long tarried ye in the earth, counting by years?<br>
113. They will say: We tarried by a day or part of a day. Ask of those who keep<br>
count!<br>
114. He will say: Ye tarried but a little if ye only knew.<br>
115. Deemed ye then that We had created you for naught, and that ye would not be<br>
returned unto Us?<br>
116. Now Allah be Exalted, the True King! There is no Allah save Him, the Lord<br>
of the Throne of Grace.<br>
117. He who crieth unto any other god along with Allah hath no proof thereof.<br>
His reckoning is only with his Lord. Lo! disbelievers will not be successful.<br>
118. And [O Muhammad] say: My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for Thou art Best of<br>
all who show mercy.<br>
<br>
SURA 24. AN-NOOR (THE LIGHT)<br>
1. [Here is] a surah which We have revealed and enjoined, and wherein We have<br>
revealed plain tokens, that haply ye may take heed.<br>
2. The adulterer and the adulteress, scourge ye each one of them [with] a<br>
hundred stripes. And let not pity for the twain withhold you from obedience to<br>
Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of believers<br>
witness their punishment.<br>
3. The adulterer shall not marry save an adulteress or an idolatress, and the<br>
adulteress none shall marry save an adulterer or an idolater. All that is<br>
forbidden unto believers.<br>
<br>
162<br>
<br>
4. And those who accuse honourable women but bring not four witnesses, scourge<br>
them [with] eighty stripes and never [afterward] accept their testimony - They<br>
indeed are evil-doers 5. Save those who afterward repent and make amends. [For such] lo! Allah is<br>
Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
6. As for those who accuse their wives but have no witnesses except themselves;<br>
let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies, [swearing] by Allah that<br>
he is of those who speak the truth;<br>
7. And yet a fifth, invoking the curse of Allah on him if he is of those who<br>
lie.<br>
8. And it shall avert the punishment from her if she bear witness before Allah<br>
four times that the thing he saith is indeed false,<br>
9. And a fifth [time] that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaketh truth.<br>
10. And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, and that<br>
Allah is Clement, Wise, [ye had been undone].<br>
11. Lo! they who spread the slander are a gang among you. Deem it not a bad<br>
thing for you; nay, it is good for you. Unto every man of them [will be paid]<br>
that which he hath earned of the sin; and as for him among them who had the<br>
greater share therein, his will be an awful doom.<br>
12. Why did not the believers, men and women, when ye heard it, think good of<br>
their own own folk, and say: It is a manifest untruth?<br>
13. Why did they not produce four witnesses? Since they produce not witnesses,<br>
they verily are liars in the sight of Allah.<br>
14. Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you in the world<br>
and the Hereafter an awful doom had overtaken you for that whereof ye murmured.<br>
15. When ye welcomed it with your tongues, and uttered with your mouths that<br>
whereof ye had no knowledge, ye counted it a trifle. In the sight of Allah it is<br>
very great.<br>
16. Wherefor, when ye heard it, said ye not: It is not for us to speak of this.<br>
Glory be to Thee [O Allah]! This is awful calumny.<br>
17. Allah admonisheth you that ye repeat not the like thereof ever, if ye are<br>
[in truth] believers.<br>
18. And He expoundeth unto you the revelations. Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
19. Lo! those who love that slander should be spread concerning those who<br>
believe, theirs will be a painful punishment in the world and the Hereafter.<br>
Allah knoweth. Ye know not.<br>
20. Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, and that<br>
Allah is Clement, Merciful, [ye had been undone].<br>
21. O ye who believe! Follow not the footsteps of the devil. Unto whomsoever<br>
followeth the footsteps of the devil, lo! he commandeth filthiness and wrong.<br>
Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, not one of you<br>
would ever have grown pure. But Allah causeth whom He will to grow. And Allah is<br>
Hearer, Knower.<br>
22. And let not those who possess dignity and ease among you swear not to give<br>
to the near of kin and to the needy, and to fugitives for the cause of Allah.<br>
Let them forgive and show indulgence. Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you?<br>
Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
<br>
163<br>
<br>
23. Lo! as for those who traduce virtuous, believing women [who are] careless,<br>
cursed are they in the world and the Hereafter. Theirs will be an awful doom<br>
24. On the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet testify against<br>
them as to what they used to do,<br>
25. On that day Allah will pay them their just due, and they will know that<br>
Allah, He is the Manifest Truth.<br>
26. Vile women are for vile men, and vile men for vile women. Good women are for<br>
good men, and good men for good women; such are innocent of that which people<br>
say: For them is pardon and a bountiful provision.<br>
27. O ye who believe! Enter not houses other than your own without first<br>
announcing your presence and invoking peace upon the folk thereof. That is<br>
better for you, that ye may be heedful.<br>
28. And if ye find no-one therein, still enter not until permission hath been<br>
given. And if it be said unto you: Go away again, then go away, for it is purer<br>
for you. Allah knoweth what ye do.<br>
29. [It is] no sin for you to enter uninhabited houses wherein is comfort for<br>
you. Allah knoweth what ye proclaim and what ye hide.<br>
30. Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for<br>
them. Lo! Allah is aware of what they do.<br>
31. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to<br>
display of their adornment only that which is apparent, and to draw their veils<br>
over their bosoms, and not to reveal their adornment save to their own husbands<br>
or fathers or husbands' fathers, or their sons or their husbands' sons, or their<br>
brothers or their brothers' sons or sisters' sons, or their women, or their<br>
slaves, or male attendants who lack vigour, or children who know naught of<br>
women's nakedness. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they<br>
hide of their adornment. And turn unto Allah together, O believers, in order<br>
that ye may succeed.<br>
32. And marry such of you as are solitary and the pious of your slaves and maidservants. If they be poor, Allah will enrich them of His bounty. Allah is of<br>
ample means, Aware.<br>
33. And let those who cannot find a match keep chaste till Allah give them<br>
independence by His grace. And such of your slaves as seek a writing [of<br>
emancipation], write it for them if ye are aware of aught of good in them, and<br>
bestow upon them of the wealth of Allah which He hath bestowed upon you. Force<br>
not your slave-girls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the<br>
world, if they would preserve their chastity. And if one force them, then [unto<br>
them], after their compulsion, lo! Allah will be Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
34. And verily We have sent down for you revelations that make plain, and the<br>
example of those who passed away before you. An admonition unto those who ward<br>
off [evil].<br>
35. Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The similitude of His light<br>
is as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass. The glass is as it were<br>
a shining star. [This lamp is] kindled from a blessed tree, an olive neither of<br>
the East nor of the West, whose oil would almost glow forth [of itself] though<br>
no fire touched it. Light upon light. Allah guideth unto His light whom He will.<br>
And Allah speaketh to mankind in allegories, for Allah is Knower of all things.<br>
36. [This lamp is found] in houses which Allah hath allowed to be exalted and<br>
that His name shall be remembered therein. Therein do offer praise to Him at<br>
morn and evening.<br>
<br>
164<br>
<br>
37. Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth from remembrance of Allah<br>
and constancy in prayer and paying to the poor their due; who fear a day when<br>
hearts and eyeballs will be overturned;<br>
38. That Allah may reward them with the best of what they did, and increase<br>
reward for them of His bounty. Allah giveth blessings without stint to whom He<br>
will.<br>
39. As for those who disbelieve, their deeds are as a mirage in a desert. The<br>
thirsty one supposeth it to be water till he cometh unto it and findeth it<br>
naught, and findeth, in the place thereof, Allah Who payeth him his due; and<br>
Allah is swift at reckoning.<br>
40. Or as darkness on a vast, abysmal sea. There covereth him a wave, above<br>
which is a wave, above which is a cloud. Layer upon layer of darkness. When he<br>
holdeth out his hand he scarce can see it. And he for whom Allah hath not<br>
appointed light, for him there is no light.<br>
41. Hast thou not seen that Allah, He it is Whom all who are in the heavens and<br>
the earth praise, and the birds in their flight? Of each He knoweth verily the<br>
worship and the praise; and Allah is Aware of what they do.<br>
42. And unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and<br>
unto Allah is the journeying.<br>
43. Hast thou not seen how Allah wafteth the clouds, then gathereth them, then<br>
maketh them layers, and thou seest the rain come forth from between them; He<br>
sendeth down from the heaven mountains wherein is hail, and smiteth therewith<br>
whom He will, and averteth it from whom He will. The flashing of His lightning<br>
all but snatcheth away the sight.<br>
44. Allah causeth the revolution of the day and the night. Lo! herein is indeed<br>
a lesson for those who see.<br>
45. Allah hath created every animal of water. Of them is [a kind] that goeth<br>
upon its belly and [a kind] that goeth upon two legs and [a kind] that goeth<br>
upon four. Allah createth what He will. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
46. Verily We have sent down revelations and explained them. Allah guideth whom<br>
He will unto a straight path.<br>
47. And they say: We believe in Allah and the messenger, and we obey; then after<br>
that a faction of them turn away. Such are not believers.<br>
48. And when they appeal unto Allah and His messenger to judge between them, lo!<br>
a faction of them are averse;<br>
49. But if right had been with them they would have come unto him willingly.<br>
50. Is there in their hearts a disease, or have they doubts, or fear they lest<br>
Allah and His messenger should wrong them in judgment? Nay, but such are evildoers.<br>
51. The saying of [all true] believers when they appeal unto Allah and His<br>
messenger to judge between them is only that they say: We hear and we obey. And<br>
such are the successful.<br>
52. He who obeyeth Allah and His messenger, and feareth Allah, and keepeth duty<br>
[unto Him]: such indeed are the victorious.<br>
53. They swear by Allah solemnly that, if thou order them, they will go forth.<br>
Say: Swear not; known obedience [is better]. Lo! Allah is Informed of what ye<br>
do.<br>
<br>
165<br>
<br>
54. Say: Obey Allah and obey the messenger. But if ye turn away, then [it is]<br>
for him [to do] only that wherewith he hath been charged, and for you [to do]<br>
only that wherewith ye have been charged. If ye obey him, ye will go aright. But<br>
the messenger hath no other charge than to convey [the message] plainly.<br>
55. Allah hath promised such of you as believe and do good work that He will<br>
surely make them to succeed [the present rulers] in the earth even as He caused<br>
those who were before them to succeed [others]; and that He will surely<br>
establish for them their religion which He hath approved for them, and will give<br>
them in exchange safety after their fear. They serve Me. They ascribe no thing<br>
as partner unto Me. Those who disbelieve henceforth, they are the miscreants.<br>
56. Establish worship and pay the poor-due and obey the messenger, that haply ye<br>
may find mercy.<br>
57. Think not that the disbelievers can escape in the land. Fire will be their<br>
home - a hapless journey's end!<br>
58. O ye who believe! Let your slaves, and those of you who have not come to<br>
puberty, ask leave of you at three times [before they come into your presence]:<br>
Before the prayer of dawn, and when ye lay aside your raiment for the heat of<br>
noon, and after the prayer of night. Three times of privacy for you. It is no<br>
sin for them or for you at other times, when some of you go round attendant upon<br>
others [if they come into your presence without leave]. Thus Allah maketh clear<br>
the revelations for you. Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
59. And when the children among you come to puberty then let them ask leave even<br>
as those before them used to ask it. Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations for<br>
you. Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
60. As for women past child-bearing, who have no hope of marriage, it is no sin<br>
for them if they discard their [outer] clothing in such a way as not to show<br>
adornment. But to refrain is better for them. Allah is Hearer, Knower.<br>
61. No blame is there upon the blind nor any blame upon the lame nor any blame<br>
upon the sick nor on yourselves if ye eat from your houses, or the houses of<br>
your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or<br>
the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your fathers' brothers, or the<br>
houses of your fathers' sisters, or the houses of your mothers' brothers, or the<br>
houses of your mothers' sisters, or [from that] whereof ye hold the keys, or<br>
[from the house] of a friend. No sin shall it be for you whether ye eat together<br>
or apart. But when ye enter houses, salute one another with a greeting from<br>
Allah, blessed and sweet. Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations for you, that<br>
haply ye may understand.<br>
62. They only are the true believers who believe in Allah and His messenger and,<br>
when they are with him on some common errand, go not away until they have asked<br>
leave of him. Lo! those who ask leave of thee, those are they who believe in<br>
Allah and His messenger. So, if they ask thy leave for some affair of theirs,<br>
give leave to whom thou wilt of them, and ask for them forgiveness of Allah. Lo!<br>
Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
63. Make not the calling of the messenger among you as your calling one of<br>
another. Allah knoweth those of you who steal away, hiding themselves. And let<br>
those who conspire to evade orders beware lest grief or painful punishment<br>
befall them.<br>
64. Lo! verily unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth.<br>
He knoweth your condition. And [He knoweth] the Day when they are returned unto<br>
Him so that He may inform them of what they did. Allah is Knower of all things.<br>
<br>
166<br>
<br>
SURA 25. AL-FURQAN (THE CRITERION, THE STANDARD)<br>
1. Blessed is He Who hath revealed unto His slave the Criterion [of right and<br>
wrong], that he may be a warner to the peoples.<br>
2. He unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, He hath<br>
chosen no son nor hath He any partner in the Sovereignty. He hath created<br>
everything and hath meted out for it a measure.<br>
3. Yet they choose beside Him other gods who create naught but are themselves<br>
created, and possess not hurt nor profit for themselves, and possess not death<br>
nor life, nor power to raise the dead.<br>
4. Those who disbelieve say: This is naught but a lie that he hath invented, and<br>
other folk have helped him with it, so that they have produced a slander and a<br>
lie.<br>
5. And they say: Fables of the men of old which he hath had written down so that<br>
they are dictated to him morn and evening.<br>
6. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: He who knoweth the secret of the heavens and the<br>
earth hath revealed it. Lo! He ever is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
7. And they say: What aileth this messenger [of Allah] that he eateth food and<br>
walketh in the markets? Why is not an angel sent down unto him, to be a warner<br>
with him.<br>
8. Or [why is not] treasure thrown down unto him, or why hath he not a paradise<br>
from whence to eat? And the evil-doers say: Ye are but following a man<br>
bewitched.<br>
9. See how they coin similitudes for thee, so that they are all astray and<br>
cannot find a road!<br>
10. Blessed is He Who, if He will, will assign thee better than [all] that Gardens underneath which rivers flow - and will assign thee mansions.<br>
11. Nay, but they deny [the coming of] the Hour, and for those who deny [the<br>
coming of] the Hour We have prepared a flame.<br>
12. When it seeth them from afar, they hear the crackling and the roar thereof.<br>
13. And when they are flung into a narrow place thereof, chained together, they<br>
pray for destruction there.<br>
14. Pray not that day for one destruction, but pray for many destructions!<br>
15. Say: Is that [doom] better or the Garden of Immortality which is promised<br>
unto those who ward off [evil]? It will be their reward and journey's end.<br>
16. Therein abiding, they have all that they desire. It is for thy Lord a<br>
promise that must be fulfilled.<br>
17. And on the day when He will assemble them and that which they worship<br>
instead of Allah and will say: Was it ye who misled these my slaves or did they<br>
[themselves] wander from the way?<br>
18. They will say: Be Thou Glorified! it was not for us to choose any protecting<br>
friends beside thee; but Thou didst give them and their fathers ease till they<br>
forgot the warning and became lost folk.<br>
19. Thus they will give you the lie regarding what ye say, then ye can neither<br>
avert [the doom] nor obtain help. And whoso among you doeth wrong, We shall make<br>
him taste great torment.<br>
<br>
167<br>
<br>
20. We never sent before thee any messengers but lo! they verily ate food and<br>
walked in the markets. And We have appointed some of you a test for others: Will<br>
ye be steadfast? And thy Lord is ever Seer.<br>
21. And those who look not for a meeting with Us say: Why are angels not sent<br>
down unto us and [Why] do we not see our Lord! Assuredly they think too highly<br>
of themselves and are scornful with great pride.<br>
22. On the day when they behold the angels, on that day there will be no good<br>
tidings for the guilty; and they will cry: A forbidding ban!<br>
23. And We shall turn unto the work they did and make it scattered motes.<br>
24. Those who have earned the Garden on that day will be better in their home<br>
and happier in their place of noonday rest;<br>
25. A day when the heaven with the clouds will be rent asunder and the angels<br>
will be sent down, a grand descent.<br>
26. The Sovereignty on that day will be the True [Sovereignty] belonging to the<br>
Beneficent One, and it will be a hard day for disbelievers.<br>
27. On the day when the wrong-doer gnaweth his hands, he will say: Ah, would<br>
that I had chosen a way together with the messenger [of Allah]!<br>
28. Alas for me! Ah, would that I had never taken such an one for friend!<br>
29. He verily led me astray from the Reminder after it had reached me. Satan was<br>
ever man's deserter in the hour of need.<br>
30. And the messenger saith: O my Lord! Lo! mine own folk make this Qur'an of no<br>
account.<br>
31. Even so have We appointed unto every prophet an opponent from among the<br>
guilty; but Allah sufficeth for a Guide and Helper.<br>
32. And those who disbelieve say: Why is the Qur'an not revealed unto him all at<br>
once? [It is revealed] thus that We may strengthen thy heart therewith; and We<br>
have arranged it in right order.<br>
33. And they bring thee no similitude but We bring thee the Truth [as against<br>
it], and better [than their similitude] as argument.<br>
34. Those who will be gathered on their faces unto hell: such are worse in<br>
plight and further from the right road.<br>
35. We verily gave Moses the Scripture and placed with him his brother Aaron as<br>
henchman.<br>
36. Then We said: Go together unto the folk who have denied Our revelations.<br>
Then We destroyed them, a complete destruction.<br>
37. And Noah's folk, when they denied the messengers, We drowned them and made<br>
of them a portent for mankind. We have prepared a painful doom for evil-doers.<br>
38. And [the tribes of] A'ad and Thamud, and the dwellers in Ar-Rass, and many<br>
generations in between.<br>
39. Each [of them] We warned by examples, and each [of them] We brought to utter<br>
ruin.<br>
40. And indeed they have passed by the township whereon was rained the fatal<br>
rain. Can it be that they have not seen it? Nay, but they hope for no<br>
resurrection.<br>
41. And when they see thee [O Muhammad] they treat thee only as a jest [saying]:<br>
Is this he whom Allah sendeth as a messenger?<br>
168<br>
<br>
42. He would have led us far away from our gods if we had not been staunch to<br>
them. They will know, when they behold the doom, who is more astray as to the<br>
road.<br>
43. Hast thou seen him who chooseth for his god his own lust? Wouldst thou then<br>
be guardian over him?<br>
44. Or deemest thou that most of them hear or understand? They are but as the<br>
cattle - nay, but they are farther astray?<br>
45. Hast thou not seen how thy Lord hath spread the shade - And if He willed He<br>
could have made it still - then We have made the sun its pilot;<br>
46. Then We withdraw it unto Us, a gradual withdrawal?<br>
47. And He it is Who maketh night a covering for you, and sleep repose, and<br>
maketh day a resurrection.<br>
48. And He it is Who sendeth the winds, glad tidings heralding His mercy, and We<br>
send down purifying water from the sky,<br>
49. That We may give life thereby to a dead land, and We give many beasts and<br>
men that We have created to drink thereof.<br>
50. And verily We have repeated it among them that they may remember, but most<br>
of mankind begrudge aught save ingratitude.<br>
51. If We willed, We could raise up a warner in every village.<br>
52. So obey not the disbelievers, but strive against them herewith with a great<br>
endeavour.<br>
53. And He it is Who hath given independence to the two seas [though they meet];<br>
one palatable, sweet, and the other saltish, bitter; and hath set a bar and a<br>
forbidding ban between them.<br>
54. And He it is Who hath created man from water, and hath appointed for him<br>
kindred by blood and kindred by marriage; for thy Lord is ever Powerful.<br>
55. Yet they worship instead of Allah that which can neither benefit them nor<br>
hurt them. The disbeliever was ever a partisan against his Lord.<br>
56. And We have sent thee [O Muhammad] only as a bearer of good tidings and a<br>
warner.<br>
57. Say: I ask of you no reward for this, save that whoso will may choose a way<br>
unto his Lord.<br>
58. And trust thou in the Living One Who dieth not, and hymn His praise. He<br>
sufficeth as the Knower of His bondmen's sins,<br>
59. Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six<br>
Days, then He mounted the Throne. The Beneficent! Ask anyone informed concerning<br>
Him!<br>
60. And when it is said unto them: Prostrate to the Beneficent! they say: And<br>
what is the Beneficent? Are we to prostrate to whatever thou [Muhammad] biddest<br>
us? And it increaseth aversion in them.<br>
61. Blessed be He Who hath placed in the heaven mansions of the stars, and hath<br>
placed therein a great lamp and a moon giving light!<br>
62. And He it is Who hath appointed night and day in succession, for him who<br>
desireth to remember, or desireth thankfulness.<br>
63. The [faithful] slaves of the Beneficent are they who walk upon the earth<br>
modestly, and when the foolish ones address them answer: Peace;<br>
169<br>
<br>
64. And who spend the night before their Lord, prostrate and standing,<br>
65. And who say: Our Lord! Avert from us the doom of hell; lo! the doom thereof<br>
is anguish;<br>
66. Lo! it is wretched as abode and station;<br>
67. And those who, when they spend, are neither prodigal nor grudging; and there<br>
is ever a firm station between the two;<br>
68. And those who cry not unto any other god along with Allah, nor take the life<br>
which Allah hath forbidden save in [course of] justice, nor commit adultery and whoso doeth this shall pay the penalty;<br>
69. The doom will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will<br>
abide therein disdained for ever;<br>
70. Save him who repenteth and believeth and doth righteous work; as for such,<br>
Allah will change their evil deeds to good deeds. Allah is ever Forgiving,<br>
Merciful.<br>
71. And whosoever repenteth and doeth good, he verily repenteth toward Allah<br>
with true repentance 72. And those who will not witness vanity, but when they pass near senseless<br>
play, pass by with dignity.<br>
73. And those who, when they are reminded of the revelations of their Lord, fall<br>
not deaf and blind thereat.<br>
74. And who say: Our Lord! Vouchsafe us comfort of our wives and of our<br>
offspring, and make us patterns for [all] those who ward off [evil].<br>
75. They will be awarded the high place forasmuch as they were steadfast, and<br>
they will meet therein with welcome and the ward of peace,<br>
76. Abiding there for ever. Happy is it as abode and station!<br>
77. Say [O Muhammad, unto the disbelievers]: My Lord would not concern Himself<br>
with you but for your prayer. But now ye have denied [the Truth], therefor there<br>
will be judgment.<br>
<br>
SURA 26. ASH-SHUARA (THE POETS)<br>
1. Ta. Sin. Mim.<br>
2. These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain.<br>
3. It may be that thou tormentest thyself [O Muhammad] because they believe not.<br>
4. If We will, We can send down on them from the sky a portent so that their<br>
necks would remain bowed before it.<br>
5. Never cometh there unto them a fresh reminder from the Beneficent One, but<br>
they turn away from it.<br>
6. Now they have denied [the Truth]; but there will come unto them tidings of<br>
that whereat they used to scoff.<br>
7. Have they not seen the earth, how much of every fruitful kind We make to grow<br>
therein?<br>
8. Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers.<br>
9. And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>
<br>
170<br>
<br>
10. And when thy Lord called Moses, saying: Go unto the wrongdoing folk,<br>
11. The folk of Pharaoh. Will they not ward off [evil]?<br>
12. He said: My Lord! Lo! I fear that they will deny me,<br>
13. And I shall be embarrassed, and my tongue will not speak plainly, therefor<br>
send for Aaron [to help me].<br>
14. And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they will kill me.<br>
15. He said: Nay, verily. So go ye twain with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with<br>
you, Hearing.<br>
16. And come together unto Pharaoh and say: Lo! we bear a message of the Lord of<br>
the Worlds,<br>
17. [Saying]: Let the Children of Israel go with us.<br>
18. [Pharaoh] said [unto Moses]: Did we not rear thee among us as a child? And<br>
thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us,<br>
19. And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst, and thou wast one of the<br>
ingrates.<br>
20. He said: I did it then, when I was of those who are astray.<br>
21. Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a command<br>
and appointed me [of the number] of those sent [by Him].<br>
22. And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me: that thou hast<br>
enslaved the Children of Israel.<br>
23. Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the Worlds?<br>
24. [Moses] said: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between<br>
them, if ye had but sure belief.<br>
25. [Pharaoh] said unto those around him: Hear ye not?<br>
26. He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers.<br>
27. [Pharaoh] said: Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a<br>
madman!<br>
28. He said: Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them, if ye<br>
did but understand.<br>
29. [Pharaoh] said: If thou choosest a god other than me, I assuredly shall<br>
place thee among the prisoners.<br>
30. He said: Even though I show thee something plain?<br>
31. [Pharaoh] said: Produce it then, if thou art of the truthful!<br>
32. Then he flung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest,<br>
33. And he drew forth his hand and lo! it was white to the beholders.<br>
34. [Pharaoh] said unto the chiefs about him: Lo! this is verily a knowing<br>
wizard,<br>
35. Who would drive you out of your land by his magic. Now what counsel ye?<br>
36. They said: Put him off, [him] and his brother, and send into the cities<br>
summoners<br>
37. Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard.<br>
38. So the wizards were gathered together at a set time on a day appointed.<br>
<br>
171<br>
<br>
39. And it was said unto the people: Are ye [also] gathering?<br>
40. [They said]: Aye, so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners.<br>
41. And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh: Will there surely be a<br>
reward for us if we are the winners?<br>
42. He said: Aye, and ye will then surely be of those brought near [to me].<br>
43. Moses said unto them: Throw what ye are going to throw!<br>
44. Then they threw down their cords and their staves and said: By Pharaoh's<br>
might, lo! we verily are the winners.<br>
45. Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it swallowed that which they did falsely<br>
show.<br>
46. And the wizards were flung prostrate,<br>
47. Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,<br>
48. The Lord of Moses and Aaron.<br>
49. [Pharaoh] said: Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he<br>
doubtless is your chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know.<br>
Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will<br>
crucify you every one.<br>
50. They said: It is no hurt, for lo! unto our Lord we shall return.<br>
51. Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are<br>
the first of the believers.<br>
52. And We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night, for ye will be<br>
pursued.<br>
53. Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners,<br>
54. [Who said]: Lo! these indeed are but a little troop,<br>
55. And lo! they are offenders against us.<br>
56. And lo! we are a ready host.<br>
57. Thus did We take them away from gardens and watersprings,<br>
58. And treasures and a fair estate.<br>
59. Thus [were those things taken from them] and We caused the Children of<br>
Israel to inherit them.<br>
60. And they overtook them at sunrise.<br>
61. And when the two hosts saw each other, those with Moses said: Lo! we are<br>
indeed caught.<br>
62. He said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me.<br>
63. Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite the sea with thy staff. And it parted,<br>
and each part was as a mountain vast.<br>
64. Then brought We near the others to that place.<br>
65. And We saved Moses and those with him, every one;<br>
66. And We drowned the others.<br>
67. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.<br>
68. And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>
<br>
172<br>
<br>
69. Recite unto them the story of Abraham:<br>
70. When he said unto his father and his folk: What worship ye?<br>
71. They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted unto them.<br>
72. He said: Do they hear you when ye cry?<br>
73. Or do they benefit or harm you?<br>
74. They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting on this wise.<br>
75. He said: See now that which ye worship,<br>
76. Ye and your forefathers!<br>
77. Lo! they are [all] an enemy unto me, save the Lord of the Worlds,<br>
78. Who created me, and He doth guide me,<br>
79. And Who feedeth me and watereth me.<br>
80. And when I sicken, then He healeth me,<br>
81. And Who causeth me to die, then giveth me life [again],<br>
82. And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment.<br>
83. My Lord! Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous.<br>
84. And give unto me a good report in later generations.<br>
85. And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight,<br>
86. And forgive my father. Lo! he is of those who err.<br>
87. And abase me not on the day when they are raised,<br>
88. The day when wealth and sons avail not [any man]<br>
89. Save him who bringeth unto Allah a whole heart.<br>
90. And the Garden will be brought nigh for those who ward off [evil].<br>
91. And hell will appear plainly to the erring.<br>
92. And it will be said unto them: Where is [all] that ye used to worship<br>
93. Instead of Allah? Can they help you or help themselves?<br>
94. Then will they be hurled therein, they and the seducers<br>
95. And the hosts of Iblis, together.<br>
96. And they will say, when they are quarrelling therein:<br>
97. By Allah, of a truth we were in error manifest<br>
98. When we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds.<br>
99. It was but the guilty who misled us.<br>
100. Now we have no intercessors<br>
101. Nor any loving friend.<br>
102. Oh, that we had another turn [on earth], that we might be of the believers!<br>
103. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers!<br>
104. And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>
105. Noah's folk denied the messengers [of Allah],<br>
<br>
173<br>
<br>
106. When their brother Noah said unto them: Will ye not ward off [evil]?<br>
107. Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,<br>
108. So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me.<br>
109. And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord<br>
of the Worlds.<br>
110. So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me.<br>
111. They said: Shall we put faith in thee, when the lowest [of the people]<br>
follow thee?<br>
112. He said: And what knowledge have I of what they may have been doing [in the<br>
past]?<br>
113. Lo! their reckoning is my Lord's concern, if ye but knew;<br>
114. And I am not [here] to repulse believers.<br>
115. I am only a plain warner.<br>
116. They said: If thou cease not, O Noah, thou wilt surely be among those<br>
stoned [to death].<br>
117. He said: My Lord! Lo! my own folk deny me.<br>
118. Therefor judge Thou between us, a [conclusive] judgment, and save me and<br>
those believers who are with me.<br>
119. And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship.<br>
120. Then afterward We drowned the others.<br>
121. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.<br>
122. And lo, thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>
123. [The tribe of] A'ad denied the messengers [of Allah].<br>
124. When their brother Hud said unto them: Will ye not ward off [evil]?<br>
125. Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,<br>
126. So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.<br>
127. And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord<br>
of the Worlds.<br>
128. Build ye on every high place a monument for vain delight?<br>
129. And seek ye out strongholds, that haply ye may last for ever?<br>
130. And if ye seize by force, seize ye as tyrants?<br>
131. Rather keep your duty to Allah, and obey me.<br>
132. Keep your duty toward Him Who hath aided you with [the good things] that ye<br>
know,<br>
133. Hath aided you with cattle and sons.<br>
134. And gardens and watersprings.<br>
135. Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an awful day.<br>
136. They said: It is all one to us whether thou preachest or art not of those<br>
who preach;<br>
137. This is but a fable of the men of old,<br>
<br>
174<br>
<br>
138. And we shall not be doomed.<br>
139. And they denied him; therefor We destroyed them. Lo! herein is indeed a<br>
portent, yet most of them are not believers.<br>
140. And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>
141. [The tribe of] Thamud denied the messengers [of Allah]<br>
142. When their brother Salih said unto them: Will ye not ward off [evil]?<br>
143. Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,<br>
144. So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.<br>
145. And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord<br>
of the Worlds.<br>
146. Will ye be left secure in that which is here before us,<br>
147. In gardens and watersprings.<br>
148. And tilled fields and heavy-sheathed palm-trees,<br>
149. Though ye hew out dwellings in the mountain, being skilful?<br>
150. Therefor keep your duty to Allah and obey me,<br>
151. And obey not the command of the prodigal,<br>
152. Who spread corruption in the earth, and reform not.<br>
153. They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched;<br>
154. Thou art but a mortal like us. So bring some token if thou art of the<br>
truthful.<br>
155. He said: [Behold] this she-camel. She hath the right to drink [at the<br>
well], and ye have the right to drink, [each] on an appointed day.<br>
156. And touch her not with ill lest there come on you the retribution of an<br>
awful day.<br>
157. But they hamstrung her, and then were penitent.<br>
158. So the retribution came on them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most<br>
of them are not believers.<br>
159. And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>
160. The folk of Lot denied the messengers [of Allah],<br>
161. When their brother Lot said unto them: Will ye not ward off [evil]?<br>
162. Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,<br>
163. So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.<br>
164. And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord<br>
of the Worlds.<br>
165. What! Of all creatures do ye come unto the males,<br>
166. And leave the wives your Lord created for you? Nay, but ye are froward<br>
folk.<br>
167. They said: If thou cease not, O Lot, thou wilt soon be of the outcast.<br>
168. He said: I am in truth of those who hate your conduct.<br>
169. My Lord! Save me and my household from what they do.<br>
<br>
175<br>
<br>
170. So We saved him and his household, every one,<br>
171. Save an old woman among those who stayed behind.<br>
172. Then afterward We destroyed the others.<br>
173. And We rained on them a rain. And dreadful is the rain of those who have<br>
been warned.<br>
174. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.<br>
175. And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>
176. The dwellers in the wood [of Midian] denied the messengers [of Allah],<br>
177. When Shu'eyb said unto them: Will ye not ward off [evil]?<br>
178. Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,<br>
179. So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.<br>
180. And I ask of you no wage for it; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of<br>
the Worlds.<br>
181. Give full measure, and be not of those who give less [than the due].<br>
182. And weigh with the true balance.<br>
183. Wrong not mankind in their goods, and do not evil, making mischief, in the<br>
earth.<br>
184. And keep your duty unto Him Who created you and the generations of the men<br>
of old.<br>
185. They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched;<br>
186. Thou art but a mortal like us, and lo! we deem thee of the liars.<br>
187. Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us, if thou art of the<br>
truthful.<br>
188. He said: My Lord is Best Aware of what ye do.<br>
189. But they denied him, so there came on them the retribution of the day of<br>
gloom. Lo! it was the retribution of an awful day.<br>
190. Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers.<br>
191. And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>
192. And lo! it is a revelation of the Lord of the Worlds,<br>
193. Which the True Spirit hath brought down<br>
194. Upon thy heart, that thou mayst be [one] of the warners,<br>
195. In plain Arabic speech.<br>
196. And lo! it is in the Scriptures of the men of old.<br>
197. Is it not a token for them that the doctors of the Children of Israel know<br>
it?<br>
198. And if We had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the Arabs,<br>
199. And he had read it unto them, they would not have believed in it.<br>
200. Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty.<br>
201. They will not believe in it till they behold the painful doom,<br>
202. So that it will come upon them suddenly, when they perceive not.<br>
176<br>
<br>
203. Then they will say: Are we to be reprieved?<br>
204. Would they [now] hasten on Our doom?<br>
205. Hast thou then seen, if We content them for [long] years,<br>
206. And then cometh that which they were promised,<br>
207. [How] that wherewith they were contented naught availeth them?<br>
208. And We destroyed no township but it had its warners<br>
209. For reminder, for We never were oppressors.<br>
210. The devils did not bring it down.<br>
211. It is not meet for them, nor is it in their power,<br>
212. Lo! verily they are banished from the hearing.<br>
213. Therefor invoke not with Allah another god, lest thou be one of the doomed.<br>
214. And warn thy tribe of near kindred,<br>
215. And lower thy wing [in kindness] unto those believers who follow thee.<br>
216. And if they [thy kinsfolk] disobey thee, say: Lo! I am innocent of what<br>
they do.<br>
217. And put thy trust in the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>
218. Who seeth thee when thou standest up [to pray]<br>
219. And [seeth] thine abasement among those who fall prostrate [in worship].<br>
220. Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower.<br>
221. Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend?<br>
222. They descend on every sinful, false one.<br>
223. They listen eagerly, but most of them are liars.<br>
224. As for poets, the erring follow them.<br>
225. Hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley,<br>
226. And how they say that which they do not?<br>
227. Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and<br>
vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. Those who do wrong will come<br>
to know by what a [great] reverse they will be overturned!<br>
<br>
SURA 27. AN-NAML (THE ANT, THE ANTS)<br>
1. Ta. Sin. These are revelations of the Qur'an and a Scripture that maketh<br>
plain;<br>
2. A guidance and good tidings for believers<br>
3. Who establish worship and pay the poor-due and are sure of the Hereafter.<br>
4. Lo! as for those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have made their works<br>
fairseeming unto them so that they are all astray.<br>
5. Those are they for whom is the worst of punishment, and in the Hereafter they<br>
will be the greatest losers.<br>
<br>
177<br>
<br>
6. Lo! as for thee [Muhammad], thou verily receivest the Qur'an from the<br>
presence of One Wise, Aware.<br>
7. [Remember] when Moses said unto his household: Lo! I spy afar off a fire; I<br>
will bring you tidings thence, or bring to you a borrowed flame that ye may warm<br>
yourselves.<br>
8. But when he reached it, he was called, saying: Blessed is Whosoever is in the<br>
fire and Whosoever is round about it! And Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the<br>
Worlds!<br>
9. O Moses! Lo! it is I, Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
10. And throw down thy staff! But when he saw it writhing as it were a demon, he<br>
turned to flee headlong; [but it was said unto him]: O Moses! Fear not! the<br>
emissaries fear not in My presence,<br>
11. Save him who hath done wrong and afterward hath changed evil for good. And<br>
lo! I am Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
12. And put thy hand into the bosom of thy robe, it will come forth white but<br>
unhurt. [This will be one] among nine tokens unto Pharaoh and his people Lo!<br>
they were ever evil-living folk.<br>
13. But when Our tokens came unto them, plain to see, they said: This is mere<br>
magic,<br>
14. And they denied them, though their souls acknowledged them, for spite and<br>
arrogance. Then see the nature of the consequence for the wrong-doers!<br>
15. And We verily gave knowledge unto David and Solomon, and they said: Praise<br>
be to Allah, Who hath preferred us above many of His believing slaves!<br>
16. And Solomon was David's heir. And he said: O mankind! Lo! we have been<br>
taught the language of birds, and have been given [abundance] of all things.<br>
This surely is evident favour.<br>
17. And there were gathered together unto Solomon his armies of the jinn and<br>
humankind, and of the birds, and they were set in battle order;<br>
18. Till, when they reached the Valley of the Ants, an ant exclaimed: O ants!<br>
Enter your dwellings lest Solomon and his armies crush you, unperceiving.<br>
19. And [Solomon] smiled, laughing at her speech, and said: My Lord, arouse me<br>
to be thankful for Thy favour wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents,<br>
and to do good that shall be pleasing unto Thee, and include me in [the number<br>
of] Thy righteous slaves.<br>
20. And he sought among the birds and said: How is it that I see not the hoopoe,<br>
or is he among the absent?<br>
21. I verily will punish him with hard punishment or I verily will slay him, or<br>
he verily shall bring me a plain excuse.<br>
22. But he was not long in coming, and he said: I have found out [a thing] that<br>
thou apprehendest not, and I come unto thee from Sheba with sure tidings.<br>
23. Lo! I found a woman ruling over them, and she hath been given [abundance] of<br>
all things, and hers is a mighty throne.<br>
24. I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah; and Satan<br>
maketh their works fairseeming unto them, and debarreth them from the way [of<br>
Truth], so that they go not aright;<br>
25. So that they worship not Allah, Who bringeth forth the hidden in the heavens<br>
and the earth, and knoweth what ye hide and what ye proclaim,<br>
178<br>
<br>
26. Allah; there is no Allah save Him, the Lord of the Tremendous Throne.<br>
27. [Solomon] said: We shall see whether thou speakest truth or whether thou art<br>
of the liars.<br>
28. Go with this my letter and throw it down unto them; then turn away and see<br>
what [answer] they return,<br>
29. [The Queen of Sheba] said [when she received the letter]: O chieftains! Lo!<br>
there hath been thrown unto me a noble letter.<br>
30. Lo! it is from Solomon, and lo! it is: In the name of Allah, the Beneficent,<br>
the Merciful;<br>
31. Exalt not yourselves against me, but come unto me as those who surrender.<br>
32. She said: O chieftains! Pronounce for me in my case. I decide no case till<br>
ye are present with me.<br>
33. They said: We are lords of might and lords of great prowess, but it is for<br>
thee to command; so consider what thou wilt command.<br>
34. She said: Lo! kings, when they enter a township, ruin it and make the honour<br>
of its people shame. Thus will they do.<br>
35. But lo! I am going to send a present unto them, and to see with what<br>
[answer] the messengers return.<br>
36. So when [the envoy] came unto Solomon, [the King] said: What! Would ye help<br>
me with wealth? But that which Allah hath given me is better than that which He<br>
hath given you. Nay it is ye [and not I] who exult in your gift.<br>
37. Return unto them. We verily shall come unto them with hosts that they cannot<br>
resist, and we shall drive them out from thence with shame, and they will be<br>
abased.<br>
38. He said: O chiefs! Which of you will bring me her throne before they come<br>
unto me, surrendering?<br>
39. A stalwart of the jinn said: I will bring it thee before thou canst rise<br>
from thy place. Lo! I verily am strong and trusty for such work.<br>
40. One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: I will bring it thee<br>
before thy gaze returneth unto thee. And when he saw it set in his presence,<br>
[Solomon] said: This is of the bounty of my Lord, that He may try me whether I<br>
give thanks or am ungrateful. Whosoever giveth thanks he only giveth thanks for<br>
[the good of] his own soul; and whosoever is ungrateful [is ungrateful only to<br>
his own soul's hurt]. For lo! my Lord is Absolute in independence, Bountiful.<br>
41. He said: Disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will go<br>
aright or be of those not rightly guided.<br>
42. So, when she came, it was said [unto her]: Is thy throne like this? She<br>
said: [It is] as though it were the very one. And [Solomon said]: We were given<br>
the knowledge before her and we had surrendered [to Allah].<br>
43. And [all] that she was wont to worship instead of Allah hindered her, for<br>
she came of disbelieving folk.<br>
44. It was said unto her: Enter the hall. And when she saw it she deemed it a<br>
pool and bared her legs. [Solomon] said: Lo! it is a hall, made smooth, of<br>
glass. She said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged myself, and I surrender with<br>
Solomon unto Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.<br>
45. And We verily sent unto Thamud their brother Salih, saying: Worship Allah.<br>
And lo! they [then became two parties quarrelling.<br>
179<br>
<br>
46. He said: O my people! Why will ye hasten on the evil rather than the good?<br>
Why will ye not ask pardon of Allah, that ye may receive mercy.<br>
47. They said: We augur evil of thee and those with thee. He said: Your evil<br>
augury is with Allah. Nay, but ye are folk that are being tested.<br>
48. And there were in the city nine persons who made mischief in the land and<br>
reformed not.<br>
49. They said: Swear one to another by Allah that we verily will attack him and<br>
his household by night, and afterward we will surely say unto his friend: We<br>
witnessed not the destruction of his household. And lo! we are truthtellers.<br>
50. So they plotted a plot: and We plotted a plot, while they perceived not.<br>
51. Then see the nature of the consequence of their plotting, for lo! We<br>
destroyed them and their people, every one.<br>
52. See, yonder are their dwellings empty and in ruins because they did wrong.<br>
Lo! herein is indeed a portent for a people who have knowledge.<br>
53. And we saved those who believed and used to ward off [evil].<br>
54. And Lot! when he said unto his folk: Will ye commit abomination knowingly?<br>
55. Must ye needs lust after men instead of women? Nay, but ye are folk who act<br>
senselessly.<br>
56. But the answer of his folk was naught save that they said: Expel the<br>
household of Lot from your township, for they [forsooth] are folk who would keep<br>
clean!<br>
57. Then We saved him and his household save his wife; We destined her to be of<br>
those who stayed behind.<br>
58. And We rained a rain upon them. Dreadful is the rain of those who have been<br>
warned.<br>
59. Say [O Muhammad]: Praise be to Allah, and peace be on His slaves whom He<br>
hath chosen! Is Allah best, or [all] that ye ascribe as partners [unto Him]?<br>
60. Is not He [best] Who created the heavens and the earth, and sendeth down for<br>
you water from the sky wherewith We cause to spring forth joyous orchards, whose<br>
trees it never hath been yours to cause to grow. Is there any Allah beside<br>
Allah? Nay, but they are folk who ascribe equals [unto Him]!<br>
61. Is not He [best] Who made the earth a fixed abode, and placed rivers in the<br>
folds thereof, and placed firm hills therein, and hath set a barrier between the<br>
two seas? Is there any Allah beside Allah? Nay, but most of them know not!<br>
62. Is not He [best] Who answereth the wronged one when he crieth unto Him and<br>
removeth the evil, and hath made you viceroys of the earth? Is there any Allah<br>
beside Allah? Little do they reflect!<br>
63. Is not He [best] Who guideth you in the darkness of the land and the sea, He<br>
Who sendeth the winds as heralds of His mercy? Is there any Allah beside Allah?<br>
High Exalted be Allah from all that they ascribe as partner [unto Him]!<br>
64. Is not He [best] Who produceth creation, then reproduceth it, and Who<br>
provideth for you from the heaven and the earth? Is there any Allah beside<br>
Allah? Say: Bring your proof, if ye are truthful!<br>
65. Say [O Muhammad]: None in the heavens and the earth knoweth the Unseen save<br>
Allah; and they know not when they will be raised [again].<br>
<br>
180<br>
<br>
66. Nay, but doth their knowledge reach to the Hereafter? Nay, for they are in<br>
doubt concerning it. Nay, for they cannot see it.<br>
67. Yet those who disbelieve say: When we have become dust like our fathers,<br>
shall we verily be brought forth [again]?<br>
68. We were promised this, forsooth, we and our fathers. [All] this is naught<br>
but fables of the men of old.<br>
69. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Travel in the land and see the nature of the<br>
sequel for the guilty!<br>
70. And grieve thou not for them, nor be in distress because of what they plot<br>
[against thee].<br>
71. And they say: When [will] this promise [be fulfilled], if ye are truthful?<br>
72. Say: It may be that a part of that which ye would hasten on is close behind<br>
you.<br>
73. Lo! thy Lord is full of bounty for mankind, but most of them do not give<br>
thanks.<br>
74. Lo! thy Lord knoweth surely all that their bosoms hide, and all that they<br>
proclaim.<br>
75. And there is nothing hidden in the heaven or the earth but it is in a clear<br>
Record.<br>
76. Lo! this Qur'an narrateth unto the Children of Israel most of that<br>
concerning which they differ.<br>
77. And lo! it is a guidance and a mercy for believers.<br>
78. Lo! thy Lord will judge between them of His wisdom, and He is the Mighty,<br>
the Wise.<br>
79. Therefor [O Muhammad] put thy trust in Allah, for thou [standest] on the<br>
plain Truth.<br>
80. Lo! thou canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to<br>
hear the call when they have turned to flee;<br>
81. Nor canst thou lead the blind out of their error. Thou canst make none to<br>
hear, save those who believe Our revelations and who have surrendered.<br>
82. And when the word is fulfilled concerning them, We shall bring forth a beast<br>
of the earth to speak unto them because mankind had not faith in Our<br>
revelations.<br>
83. And [remind them of] the Day when We shall gather out of every nation a host<br>
of those who denied Our revelations, and they will be set in array;<br>
84. Till, when they come [before their Lord], He will say: Did ye deny My<br>
revelations when ye could not compass them in knowledge, or what was it that ye<br>
did?<br>
85. And the Word will be fulfilled concerning them because they have done wrong,<br>
and they will not speak.<br>
86. Have they not seen how We have appointed the night that they may rest<br>
therein, and the day sight-giving? Lo! therein verily are portents for a people<br>
who believe.<br>
87. And [remind them of] the Day when the Trumpet will be blown, and all who are<br>
in the heavens and the earth will start in fear, save him whom Allah willeth.<br>
And all come unto Him, humbled.<br>
181<br>
<br>
88. And thou seest the hills thou deemest solid flying with the flight of<br>
clouds: the doing of Allah Who perfecteth all things. Lo! He is Informed of what<br>
ye do.<br>
89. Whoso bringeth a good deed will have better than its worth; and such are<br>
safe from fear that Day.<br>
90. And whoso bringeth an ill-deed, such will be flung down on their faces in<br>
the Fire. Are ye rewarded aught save what ye did?<br>
91. [Say]: I [Muhammad] am commanded only to serve the Lord of this land which<br>
He hath hallowed, and unto Whom all things belong. And I am commanded to be of<br>
those who surrender [unto Him],<br>
92. And to recite the Qur'an. And whoso goeth right, goeth right only for [the<br>
good of] his own soul; and as for him who goeth astray - [Unto him] say: Lo! I<br>
am only a warner.<br>
93. And say: Praise be to Allah Who will show you His portents so that ye shall<br>
know them. And thy Lord is not unaware of what ye [mortals] do.<br>
<br>
SURA 28. AL-QASAS (THE STORY, STORIES)<br>
1. Ta. Sin. Mim.<br>
2. These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain.<br>
3. We narrate unto thee [somewhat] of the story of Moses and Pharaoh with truth,<br>
for folk who believe.<br>
4. Lo! Pharaoh exalted himself in the earth and made its people castes. A tribe<br>
among them he oppressed, killing their sons and sparing their women. Lo! he was<br>
of those who work corruption.<br>
5. And We desired to show favour unto those who were oppressed in the earth, and<br>
to make them examples and to make them the inheritors,<br>
6. And to establish them in the earth, and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their<br>
hosts that which they feared from them.<br>
7. And We inspired the mother of Moses, saying: Suckle him and, when thou<br>
fearest for him, then cast him into the river and fear not nor grieve. Lo! We<br>
shall bring him back unto thee and shall make him [one] of Our messengers.<br>
8. And the family of Pharaoh took him up, that he might become for them an enemy<br>
and a sorrow, Lo! Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were ever sinning.<br>
9. And the wife of Pharaoh said: [He will be] a consolation for me and for thee.<br>
Kill him not. Peradventure he may be of use to us, or we may choose him for a<br>
son. And they perceived not.<br>
10. And the heart of the mother of Moses became void, and she would have<br>
betrayed him if We had not fortified her heart, that she might be of the<br>
believers.<br>
11. And she said unto his sister: Trace him. So she observed him from afar, and<br>
they perceived not.<br>
12. And We had before forbidden foster-mothers for him, so she said: Shall I<br>
show you a household who will rear him for you and take care of him?<br>
13. So We restored him to his mother that she might be comforted and not grieve,<br>
and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of them know<br>
not.<br>
182<br>
<br>
14. And when he reached his full strength and was ripe, We gave him wisdom and<br>
knowledge. Thus do We reward the good.<br>
15. And he entered the city at a time of carelessness of its folk, and he found<br>
therein two men fighting, one of his own caste, and the other of his enemies;<br>
and he who was of his caste asked him for help against him who was of his<br>
enemies. So Moses struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: This is of<br>
the devil's doing. Lo! he is an enemy, a mere misleader.<br>
16. He said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged my soul, so forgive me. Then He forgave<br>
him. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.<br>
17. He said: My Lord! Forasmuch as Thou hast favoured me, I will nevermore be a<br>
supporter of the guilty.<br>
18. And morning found him in the city, fearing, vigilant, when behold! he who<br>
had appealed to him the day before cried out to him for help. Moses said unto<br>
him: Lo! thou art indeed a mere hothead.<br>
19. And when he would have fallen upon the man who was an enemy unto them both,<br>
he said: O Moses! Wouldst thou kill me as thou didst kill a person yesterday.<br>
Thou wouldst be nothing but a tyrant in the land, thou wouldst not be of the<br>
reformers.<br>
20. And a man came from the uttermost part of the city, running. He said: O<br>
Moses! Lo! the chiefs take counsel against thee to slay thee; therefor escape.<br>
Lo! I am of those who give thee good advice.<br>
21. So he escaped from thence, fearing, vigilant. He said: My Lord! Deliver me<br>
from the wrongdoing folk.<br>
22. And when he turned his face toward Midian, he said: Peradventure my Lord<br>
will guide me in the right road.<br>
23. And when he came unto the water of Midian he found there a whole tribe of<br>
men, watering. And he found apart from them two women keeping back [their<br>
flocks]. He said: What aileth you? The two said: We cannot give [our flocks] to<br>
drink till the shepherds return from the water; and our father is a very old<br>
man.<br>
24. So he watered [their flock] for them. Then he turned aside into the shade,<br>
and said: My Lord! I am needy of whatever good Thou sendest down for me.<br>
25. Then there came unto him one of the two women, walking shyly. She said: Lo!<br>
my father biddeth thee, that he may reward thee with a payment for that thou<br>
didst water [the flock] for us. Then, when he came unto him and told him the<br>
[whole] story, he said: Fear not! Thou hast escaped from the wrongdoing folk.<br>
26. One of the two women said: O my father! Hire him! For the best [man] that<br>
thou canst hire in the strong, the trustworthy.<br>
27. He said: Lo! I fain would marry thee to one<br>
on condition that thou hirest thyself to me for<br>
Then if thou completest ten it will be of thine<br>
it hard for thee. Allah willing, thou wilt find<br>
<br>
of these two daughters of mine<br>
[the term of] eight pilgrimages.<br>
own accord, for I would not make<br>
me of the righteous.<br>
<br>
28. He said: That [is settled] between thee and me. Whichever of the two terms I<br>
fulfil, there will be no injustice to me, and Allah is Surety over what we say.<br>
29. Then, when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his<br>
housefolk, he saw in the distance a fire and said unto his housefolk: Bide ye<br>
[here]. Lo! I see in the distance a fire; peradventure I shall bring you tidings<br>
thence, or a brand from the fire that ye may warm yourselves.<br>
<br>
183<br>
<br>
30. And when he reached it, he was called from the right side of the valley in<br>
the blessed field, from the tree: O Moses! Lo! I, even I, am Allah, the Lord of<br>
the Worlds;<br>
31. Throw down thy staff. And when he saw it writhing as it had been a demon, he<br>
turned to flee headlong, [and it was said unto him]: O Moses! Draw nigh and fear<br>
not. Lo! thou art of those who are secure.<br>
32. Thrust thy hand into the bosom of thy robe it will come forth white without<br>
hurt. And guard thy heart from fear. Then these shall be two proofs from your<br>
Lord unto Pharaoh and his chiefs. Lo! they are evil-living folk.<br>
33. He said: My Lord! Lo! I killed a man among them and I fear that they will<br>
kill me.<br>
34. My brother Aaron is more eloquent than me in speech. Therefor send him with<br>
me as a helper to confirm me. Lo! I fear that they will give the lie to me.<br>
35. He said: We will strengthen thine arm with thy brother, and We will give<br>
unto you both power so that they cannot reach you for Our portents. Ye twain,<br>
and those who follow you, will be the winners.<br>
36. But when Moses came unto them with Our clear tokens, they said: This is<br>
naught but invented magic. We never heard of this among our fathers of old.<br>
37. And Moses said: My Lord is Best Aware of him who bringeth guidance from His<br>
presence, and whose will be the sequel of the Home [of bliss]. Lo! wrong-doers<br>
will not be successful.<br>
38. And Pharaoh said: O chiefs! I know not that ye have a god other than me, so<br>
kindle for me [a fire], O Haman, to bake the mud; and set up for me a lofty<br>
tower in order that I may survey the god of Moses; and lo! I deem him of the<br>
liars.<br>
39. And he and his hosts were haughty in the land without right, and deemed that<br>
they would never be brought back to Us.<br>
40. Therefor We seized him and his hosts, and abandoned them unto the sea.<br>
Behold the nature of the consequence for evil-doers!<br>
41. And We made them patterns that invite unto the Fire, and on the Day of<br>
Resurrection they will not be helped.<br>
42. And We made a curse to follow them in this world, and on the Day of<br>
Resurrection they will be among the hateful.<br>
43. And We verily gave the Scripture unto Moses after We had destroyed the<br>
generations of old: clear testimonies for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy,<br>
that haply they might reflect.<br>
44. And thou [Muhammad] wast not on the western side [of the Mount] when We<br>
expounded unto Moses the commandment, and thou wast not among those present;<br>
45. But We brought forth generations, and their lives dragged on for them. And<br>
thou wast not a dweller in Midian, reciting unto them Our revelations, but We<br>
kept sending [messengers to men].<br>
46. And thou was not beside the Mount when We did call; but [the knowledge of it<br>
is] a mercy from thy Lord that thou mayst warn a folk unto whom no warner came<br>
before thee, that haply they may give heed.<br>
47. Otherwise, if disaster should afflict them because of that which their own<br>
hands have sent before [them], they might say: Our Lord! Why sentest Thou no<br>
messenger unto us, that we might have followed Thy revelations and been of the<br>
believers?<br>
184<br>
<br>
48. But when there came unto them the Truth from Our presence, they said: Why is<br>
he not given the like of what was given unto Moses? Did they not disbelieve in<br>
that which was given unto Moses of old? They say: Two magics that support each<br>
other; and they say: Lo! in both we are disbelievers.<br>
49. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Then bring a scripture from the presence of<br>
Allah that giveth clearer guidance than these two [that] I may follow it, if ye<br>
are truthful.<br>
50. And if they answer thee not, then know that what they follow is their lusts.<br>
And who goeth farther astray than he who followeth his lust without guidance<br>
from Allah. Lo! Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.<br>
51. And now verily We have caused the Word to reach them, that haply they may<br>
give heed.<br>
52. Those unto whom We gave the Scripture before it, they believe in it,<br>
53. And when it is recited unto them, they say: We believe in it. Lo! it is the<br>
Truth from our Lord. Lo! even before it we were of those who surrender [unto<br>
Him].<br>
54. These will be given their reward twice over, because they are steadfast and<br>
repel evil with good, and spend of that wherewith We have provided them,<br>
55. And when they hear vanity they withdraw from it and say: Unto us our works<br>
and unto you your works. Peace be unto you! We desire not the ignorant.<br>
56. Lo! thou [O Muhammad] guidest not whom thou lovest, but Allah guideth whom<br>
He will. And He is Best Aware of those who walk aright.<br>
57.<br>
out<br>
the<br>
But<br>
<br>
And they say: If we were to follow the Guidance with thee we should be torn<br>
of our land. Have We not established for them a sure sanctuary, whereunto<br>
produce of all things is brought [in trade], a provision from Our presence?<br>
most of them know not.<br>
<br>
58. And how many a community have We destroyed that was thankless for its means<br>
of livelihood! And yonder are their dwellings, which have not been inhabited<br>
after them save a little. And We, even We, were the inheritors.<br>
59. And never did thy Lord destroy the townships, till He had raised up in their<br>
mother[-town] a messenger reciting unto them Our revelations. And never did We<br>
destroy the townships unless the folk thereof were evil-doers.<br>
60. And whatsoever ye have been given is a comfort of the life of the world and<br>
an ornament thereof; and that which Allah hath is better and more lasting. Have<br>
ye then no sense?<br>
61. Is he whom We have promised a fair promise which he will find [true] like<br>
him whom We suffer to enjoy awhile the comfort of the life of the world, then on<br>
the Day of Resurrection he will be of those arraigned?<br>
62. On the day when He will call unto them and say: Where are My partners whom<br>
ye imagined?<br>
63. Those concerning whom the Word will have come true will say: Our Lord! These<br>
are they whom we led astray. We led them astray even as we ourselves were<br>
astray. We declare our innocence before Thee: us they never worshipped.<br>
64. And it will be said: Cry unto your [so-called] partners [of Allah]. And they<br>
will cry unto them, and they will give no answer unto them, and they will see<br>
the Doom. Ah, if they had but been guided!<br>
65. And on the Day when He will call unto them and say: What answer gave ye to<br>
the messengers?<br>
185<br>
<br>
66. On that day [all] tidings will be dimmed for them, nor will they ask one of<br>
another,<br>
67. But as for him who shall repent and believe and do right, he haply may be<br>
one of the successful.<br>
68. Thy Lord bringeth to pass what He willeth and chooseth. They have never any<br>
choice. Glorified be Allah and Exalted above all that they associate [with Him]!<br>
69. And thy Lord knoweth what their breasts conceal, and what they publish.<br>
70. And He is Allah; there is no Allah save Him. His is all praise in the former<br>
and the latter [state], and His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought<br>
back.<br>
71. Say: Have ye thought, if Allah made night everlasting for you till the Day<br>
of Resurrection, who is a god beside Allah who could bring you light? Will ye<br>
not then hear?<br>
72. Say: Have ye thought, if Allah made day everlasting for you till the Day of<br>
Resurrection, who is a god beside Allah who could bring you night wherein ye<br>
rest? Will ye not then see?<br>
73. Of His mercy hath He appointed for you night and day, that therein ye may<br>
rest, and that ye may seek His bounty, and that haply ye may be thankful.<br>
74. And on the Day when He shall call unto them and say: Where are My partners<br>
whom ye pretended?<br>
75. And We shall take out from every nation a witness and We shall say: Bring<br>
your proof. Then they will know that Allah hath the Truth, and all that they<br>
invented will have failed them.<br>
76. Now Korah was of Moses' folk, but he oppressed them; and We gave him so much<br>
treasure that the stores thereof would verily have been a burden for a troop of<br>
mighty men. When his own folk said unto him: Exult not; lo! Allah loveth not the<br>
exultant;<br>
77. But seek the abode of the Hereafter in that which Allah hath given thee and<br>
neglect not thy portion of the world, and be thou kind even as Allah hath been<br>
kind to thee, and seek not corruption in the earth; lo! Allah loveth not<br>
corrupters,<br>
78. He said: I have been given it only on account of knowledge I possess. Knew<br>
he not that Allah had destroyed already of the generations before him men who<br>
were mightier than him in strength and greater in respect of following? The<br>
guilty are not questioned of their sins.<br>
79. Then went he forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of<br>
the life of the world said: Ah, would that we had the like of what hath been<br>
given unto Korah! Lo! he is lord of rare good fortune.<br>
80. But those who had been given knowledge said: Woe unto you! The reward of<br>
Allah for him who believeth and doeth right is better, and only the steadfast<br>
will obtain it.<br>
81. So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling-place. Then he had no<br>
host to help him against Allah, nor was he of those who can save themselves.<br>
82. And morning found those who had coveted his place but yesterday crying: Ah,<br>
welladay! Allah enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His slaves and<br>
straiteneth it [for whom He will]. If Allah had not been gracious unto us He<br>
would have caused it to swallow us [also]. Ah, welladay! the disbelievers never<br>
prosper.<br>
<br>
186<br>
<br>
83. As for that Abode of the Hereafter We assign it unto those who seek not<br>
oppression in the earth, nor yet corruption. The sequel is for those who ward<br>
off [evil].<br>
84. Whoso bringeth a good deed, he will have better than the same; while as for<br>
him who bringeth an ill-deed, those who do ill-deeds will be requited only what<br>
they did.<br>
85. Lo! He Who hath given thee the Qur'an for a law will surely bring thee home<br>
again. Say: My Lord is Best Aware of him who bringeth guidance and him who is in<br>
error manifest.<br>
86. Thou hadst no hope that the Scripture would be inspired in thee; but it is a<br>
mercy from thy Lord, so never be a helper to the disbelievers.<br>
87. And let them not divert thee from the revelations of Allah after they have<br>
been sent down unto thee; but call [mankind] unto thy Lord, and be not of those<br>
who ascribe partners [unto Him].<br>
88. And cry not unto any other god along with Allah. There is no Allah save Him.<br>
Everything will perish save His countenance. His is the command, and unto Him ye<br>
will be brought back.<br>
<br>
SURA 29. AL-ANKABOOT (THE SPIDER)<br>
1. Alif. Lam. Mim.<br>
2. Do men imagine that they will be left [at ease] because they say, We believe,<br>
and will not be tested with affliction?<br>
3. Lo! We tested those who were before you. Thus Allah knoweth those who are<br>
sincere, and knoweth those who feign.<br>
4. Or do those who do ill-deeds imagine that they can outstrip Us? Evil [for<br>
them] is that which they decide.<br>
5. Whoso looketh forward to the meeting with Allah [let him know that] Allah's<br>
reckoning is surely nigh, and He is the Hearer, the Knower.<br>
6. And whosoever striveth, striveth only for himself, for lo! Allah is<br>
altogether Independent of [His] creatures.<br>
7. And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall remit from them<br>
their evil deeds and shall repay them the best that they did.<br>
8. We have enjoined on man kindness to parents; but if they strive to make thee<br>
join with Me that of which thou hast no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me<br>
is your return and I shall tell you what ye used to do.<br>
9. And as for those who believe and do good works, We verily shall make them<br>
enter in among the righteous.<br>
10. Of mankind is he who saith: We believe in Allah, but, if he be made to<br>
suffer for the sake of Allah, he mistaketh the persecution of mankind for<br>
Allah's punishment; and then, if victory cometh from thy Lord, will say: Lo! we<br>
were with you [all the while]. Is not Allah Best Aware of what is in the bosoms<br>
of [His] creatures?<br>
11. Verily Allah knoweth those who believe, and verily He knoweth the<br>
hypocrites.<br>
<br>
187<br>
<br>
12. Those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Follow our way [of<br>
religion] and we verily will bear your sins [for you]. They cannot bear aught of<br>
their sins. Lo! they verily are liars.<br>
13. But they verily will bear their own loads and other loads beside their own,<br>
and they verily will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection concerning that<br>
which they invented.<br>
14. And verily we sent Noah [as Our messenger] unto his folk, and he continued<br>
with them for a thousand years save fifty years; and the flood engulfed them,<br>
for they were wrong-doers.<br>
15. And We rescued him and those with him in the ship, and made of it a portent<br>
for the peoples.<br>
16. And Abraham! [Remember] when he said unto his folk: Serve Allah, and keep<br>
your duty unto Him; that is better for you if ye did but know.<br>
17. Ye serve instead of Allah only idols, and ye only invent a lie. Lo! those<br>
whom ye serve instead of Allah own no provision for you. So seek your provision<br>
from Allah, and serve Him, and give thanks unto Him, [for] unto Him ye will be<br>
brought back.<br>
18. But if ye deny, then nations have denied before you. The messenger is only<br>
to convey [the message] plainly.<br>
19. See they not how Allah produceth creation, then reproduceth it? Lo! for<br>
Allah that is easy.<br>
20. Say [O Muhammad]: Travel in the land and see how He originated creation,<br>
then Allah bringeth forth the later growth. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
21. He punisheth whom He will and showeth mercy unto whom He will, and unto Him<br>
ye will be turned.<br>
22. Ye cannot escape [from Him] in the earth or in the sky, and beside Allah<br>
there is for you no friend or helper.<br>
23. Those who disbelieve in the revelations of Allah and in [their] Meeting with<br>
Him, such have no hope of My mercy. For such there is a painful doom.<br>
24. But the answer of his folk was only that they said: "Kill him" or "Burn<br>
him." Then Allah saved him from the Fire. Lo! herein verily are portents for<br>
folk who believe.<br>
25. He said: Ye have chosen only idols instead of Allah. The love between you is<br>
only in the life of the world. Then on the Day of Resurrection ye will deny each<br>
other and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and ye will have no<br>
helpers.<br>
26. And Lot believed him, and said: Lo! I am a fugitive unto my Lord. Lo! He,<br>
only He, is the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
27. And We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and We established the prophethood<br>
and the Scripture among his seed, and We gave him his reward in the world, and<br>
lo! in the Hereafter he verily is among the righteous.<br>
28. And Lot! [Remember] when he said unto his folk: Lo! ye commit lewdness such<br>
as no creature did before you.<br>
29. For come ye not in unto males, and cut ye not the road [for travellers], and<br>
commit ye not abomination in your meetings? But the answer of his folk was only<br>
that they said: Bring Allah's doom upon us if thou art a truthteller!<br>
30. He said: My Lord! Give me victory over folk who work corruption.<br>
<br>
188<br>
<br>
31. And when Our messengers brought Abraham the good news, they said: Lo! we are<br>
about to destroy the people of that township, for its people are wrong-doers.<br>
32. He said: Lo! Lot is there. They said: We are best aware of who is there. We<br>
are to deliver him and his household, all save his wife, who is of those who<br>
stay behind.<br>
33. And when Our messengers came unto Lot, he was troubled upon their account,<br>
for he could not protect them; but they said: Fear not, nor grieve! Lo! we are<br>
to deliver thee and thy household, [all] save thy wife, who is of those who stay<br>
behind.<br>
34. Lo! We are about to bring down upon the folk of this township a fury from<br>
the sky because they are evil-livers.<br>
35. And verily of that We have left a clear sign for people who have sense.<br>
36. And unto Midian We sent Shu'eyb, their brother. He said: O my people! Serve<br>
Allah, and look forward to the Last Day, and do not evil, making mischief, in<br>
the earth.<br>
37. But they denied him, and the dreadful earthquake took them, and morning<br>
found them prostrate in their dwelling place.<br>
38. And [the tribes of] A'ad and Thamud! [Their fate] is manifest unto you from<br>
their [ruined and deserted] dwellings. Satan made their deeds seem fair unto<br>
them and so debarred them from the Way, though they were keen observers.<br>
39. And Korah, Pharaoh and Haman! Moses came unto them with clear proofs [of<br>
Allah's Sovereignty], but they were boastful in the land. And they were not<br>
winners [in the race].<br>
40. So We took each one in his sin; of them was he on whom We sent a hurricane,<br>
and of them was he who was overtaken by the [Awful] Cry, and of them was he whom<br>
We caused the earth to swallow, and of them was he whom We drowned. It was not<br>
for Allah to wrong them, but they wronged themselves.<br>
41. The likeness of those who choose other patrons than Allah is as the likeness<br>
of the spider when she taketh unto herself a house, and lo! the frailest of all<br>
houses is the spider's house, if they but knew.<br>
42. Lo! Allah knoweth what thing they invoke instead of Him. He is the Mighty,<br>
the Wise.<br>
43. As for these similitudes, We coin them for mankind, but none will grasp<br>
their meaning save the wise.<br>
44. Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth. Lo! therein is indeed a<br>
portent for believers.<br>
45. Recite that which hath been inspired in thee of the Scripture, and establish<br>
worship. Lo! worship preserveth from lewdness and iniquity, but verily<br>
remembrance of Allah is more important. And Allah knoweth what ye do.<br>
46. And argue not with the People of the Scripture unless it be in [a way] that<br>
is better, save with such of them as do wrong; and say: We believe in that which<br>
hath been revealed unto us and revealed unto you; our Allah and your Allah is<br>
One, and unto Him we surrender.<br>
47. In like manner We have revealed unto thee the Scripture, and those unto whom<br>
We gave the Scripture aforetime will believe therein; and of these [also] there<br>
are some who believe therein. And none deny Our revelations save the<br>
disbelievers.<br>
<br>
189<br>
<br>
48. And thou [O Muhammad] wast not a reader of any scripture before it, nor<br>
didst thou write it with thy right hand, for then might those have doubted, who<br>
follow falsehood.<br>
49. But it is clear revelations in the hearts of those who have been given<br>
knowledge, and none deny Our revelations save wrong-doers.<br>
50. And they say: Why are not portents sent down upon him from his Lord? Say:<br>
Portents are with Allah only, and I am but a plain warner.<br>
51. Is it not enough for them that We have sent down unto thee the Scripture<br>
which is read unto them? Lo! herein verily is mercy, and a reminder for folk who<br>
believe.<br>
52. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Allah sufficeth for witness between me and you.<br>
He knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who believe in<br>
vanity and disbelieve in Allah, they it is who are the losers.<br>
53. They bid thee hasten on the doom [of Allah]. And if a term had not been<br>
appointed, the doom would assuredly have come unto them [ere now]. And verily it<br>
will come upon them suddenly when they perceive not.<br>
54. They bid thee hasten on the doom, when lo! hell verily will encompass the<br>
disbelievers<br>
55. On the day when the doom will overwhelm them from above them and from<br>
underneath their feet, and He will say: Taste what ye used to do!<br>
56. O my bondmen who believe! Lo! My earth is spacious. Therefor serve Me only.<br>
57. Every soul will taste of death. Then unto Us ye will be returned.<br>
58. Those who believe and do good works, them verily We shall house in lofty<br>
dwellings of the Garden underneath which rivers flow. There they will dwell<br>
secure. How sweet the guerdon of the toilers,<br>
59. Who persevere, and put their trust in their Lord!<br>
60. And how many an animal there is that beareth not its own provision! Allah<br>
provideth for it and for you. He is the Hearer, the Knower.<br>
61. And if thou wert to ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth, and<br>
constrained the sun and the moon [to their appointed work]? they would say:<br>
Allah. How then are they turned away?<br>
62. Allah maketh the provision wide for whom He will of His bondmen, and<br>
straiteneth it for whom [He will]. Lo! Allah is Aware of all things.<br>
63. And if thou wert to ask them: Who causeth water to come down from the sky,<br>
and therewith reviveth the earth after its death? they verily would say: Allah.<br>
Say: Praise be to Allah! But most of them have no sense.<br>
64. This life of the world is but a pastime and a game. Lo! the home of the<br>
Hereafter - that is Life, if they but knew.<br>
65. And when they mount upon the ships they pray to Allah, making their faith<br>
pure for Him only, but when He bringeth them safe to land, behold! they ascribe<br>
partners [unto Him],<br>
66. That they may disbelieve in that which We have given them, and that they may<br>
take their ease. But they will come to know.<br>
67. Have they not seen that We have appointed a sanctuary immune [from<br>
violence], while mankind are ravaged all around them? Do they then believe in<br>
falsehood and disbelieve in the bounty of Allah?<br>
<br>
190<br>
<br>
68. Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah, or<br>
denieth the truth when it cometh unto him? Is not there a home in hell for<br>
disbelievers?<br>
69. As for those who strive in Us, We surely guide them to Our paths, and lo!<br>
Allah is with the good.<br>
<br>
SURA 30. AR-ROOM (THE ROMANS, THE BYZANTINES)<br>
1. Alif. Lam. Mim.<br>
2. The Romans have been defeated<br>
3. In the nearer land, and they, after their defeat will be victorious<br>
4. Within ten years - Allah's is the command in the former case and in the<br>
latter - and in that day believers will rejoice<br>
5. In Allah's help to victory. He helpeth to victory whom He will. He is the<br>
Mighty, the Merciful.<br>
6. It is a promise of Allah. Allah faileth not His promise, but most of mankind<br>
know not.<br>
7. They know only some appearance of the life of the world, and are heedless of<br>
the Hereafter.<br>
8. Have they not pondered upon themselves? Allah created not the heavens and the<br>
earth, and that which is between them, save with truth and for a destined end.<br>
But truly many of mankind are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord.<br>
9. Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence<br>
for those who were before them? They were stronger than these in power, and they<br>
dug the earth and built upon it more than these have built. Messengers of their<br>
own came unto them with clear proofs [of Allah's Sovereignty]. Surely Allah<br>
wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves.<br>
10. Then evil was the consequence to those who dealt in evil, because they<br>
denied the revelations of Allah and made a mock of them.<br>
11. Allah produceth creation, then He reproduceth it, then unto Him ye will be<br>
returned.<br>
12. And in the day when the Hour riseth the unrighteous will despair.<br>
13. There will be none to intercede for them of those whom they made equal with<br>
Allah. And they will reject their partners [whom they ascribed unto Him].<br>
14. In the day when the Hour cometh, in that day they will be sundered.<br>
15. As for those who believed and did good works, they will be made happy in a<br>
Garden.<br>
16. But as for those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations, and denied the<br>
meeting of the Hereafter, such will be brought to doom.<br>
17. So glory be to Allah when ye enter the night and when ye enter the morning 18. Unto Him be praise in the heavens and the earth! - and at the sun's decline<br>
and in the noonday.<br>
19. He bringeth forth the living from the dead, and He bringeth forth the dead<br>
from the living, and He reviveth the earth after her death. And even so will ye<br>
be brought forth.<br>
<br>
191<br>
<br>
20. And of His signs is this: He created you of dust, and behold you human<br>
beings, ranging widely!<br>
21. And of His signs is this: He created for you helpmeets from yourselves that<br>
ye might find rest in them, and He ordained between you love and mercy. Lo!<br>
herein indeed are portents for folk who reflect.<br>
22. And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the<br>
difference of your languages and colours. Lo! herein indeed are portents for men<br>
of knowledge.<br>
23. And of His signs is your slumber by night and by day, and your seeking of<br>
His bounty. Lo! herein indeed are portents for folk who heed.<br>
24. And of His signs is this: He showeth you the lightning for a fear and for a<br>
hope, and sendeth down water from the sky, and thereby quickeneth the earth<br>
after her death. Lo! herein indeed are portents for folk who understand.<br>
25. And of His signs is this: The heavens and the earth stand fast by His<br>
command, and afterward, when He calleth you, lo! from the earth ye will emerge.<br>
26. Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. All are<br>
obedient unto Him.<br>
27. He it is Who produceth creation, then reproduceth it, and it is easier for<br>
Him. His is the Sublime Similitude in the heavens and the earth. He is the<br>
Mighty, the Wise.<br>
28. He coineth for you a similitude of yourselves. Have ye, from among those<br>
whom your right hands possess, partners in the wealth We have bestowed upon you,<br>
equal with you in respect thereof, so that ye fear them as ye fear each other<br>
[that ye ascribe unto Us partners out of that which We created]? Thus We display<br>
the revelations for people who have sense.<br>
29. Nay, but those who do wrong follow their own lusts without knowledge. Who is<br>
able to guide him whom Allah hath sent astray? For such there are no helpers.<br>
30. So set thy purpose [O Muhammad] for religion as a man by nature upright the nature [framed] of Allah, in which He hath created man. There is no altering<br>
[the laws of] Allah's creation. That is the right religion, but most men know<br>
not 31. Turning unto Him [only]; and be careful of your duty unto Him and establish<br>
worship, and be not of those who ascribe partners [unto Him];<br>
32. Of those who split up their religion and became schismatics, each sect<br>
exulting in its tenets.<br>
33. And when harm toucheth men they cry unto their Lord, turning to Him in<br>
repentance; then, when they have tasted of His mercy, behold! some of them<br>
attribute partners to their Lord<br>
34. So as to disbelieve in that which We have given them. [Unto such it is<br>
said]: Enjoy yourselves awhile, but ye will come to know.<br>
35. Or have We revealed unto them any warrant which speaketh of that which they<br>
associate with Him?<br>
36. And when We cause mankind to taste of mercy they rejoice therein; but if an<br>
evil thing befall them as the consequence of their own deeds, lo! they are in<br>
despair!<br>
37. See they not that Allah enlargeth the provision for whom He will, and<br>
straiteneth [it for whom He will]. Lo! herein indeed are portents for folk who<br>
believe.<br>
192<br>
<br>
38. So give to the kinsman his due, and to the needy, and to the wayfarer. That<br>
is best for those who seek Allah's Countenance. And such are they who are<br>
successful.<br>
39. That which ye give in usury in order that it may increase on [other]<br>
people's property hath no increase with Allah; but that which ye give in<br>
charity, seeking Allah's Countenance, hath increase manifold.<br>
40. Allah is He Who created you and then sustained you, then causeth you to die,<br>
then giveth life to you again. Is there any of your [so-called] partners [of<br>
Allah] that doeth aught of that? Praised and Exalted be He above what they<br>
associate [with Him]!<br>
41. Corruption doth appear on land and sea because of [the evil] which men's<br>
hands have done, that He may make them taste a part of that which they have<br>
done, in order that they may return.<br>
42. Say [O Muhammad, to the disbelievers]: Travel in the land, and see the<br>
nature of the consequence for those who were before you! Most of them were<br>
idolaters.<br>
43. So set thy purpose resolutely for the right religion, before the inevitable<br>
day cometh from Allah. On that day mankind will be sundered44. Whoso disbelieveth must [then] bear the consequences of his disbelief, while<br>
those who do right make provision for themselves 45. That He may reward out of His bounty those who believe and do good works.<br>
Lo! He loveth not the disbelievers [in His guidance].<br>
46. And of His signs is this: He sendeth herald winds to make you taste His<br>
mercy, and that the ships may sail at His command, and that ye may seek his<br>
favour, and that haply ye may be thankful.<br>
47. Verily We sent before thee [Muhammad] messengers to their own folk. Then we<br>
took vengeance upon those who were guilty [in regard to them]. To help believers<br>
is ever incumbent upon Us.<br>
48. Allah is He Who sendeth the winds so that they raise clouds, and spreadeth<br>
them along the sky as pleaseth Him, and causeth them to break and thou seest the<br>
rain downpouring from within them. And when He maketh it to fall on whom He will<br>
of His bondmen, lo! they rejoice;<br>
49. Though before that, even before it was sent down upon them, they were in<br>
despair.<br>
50. Look, therefore, at the prints of Allah's mercy [in creation]: how He<br>
quickeneth the earth after her death. Lo! He verily is the Quickener of the<br>
Dead, and He is Able to do all things.<br>
51. And if We sent a wind and they beheld it yellow, they verily would still<br>
continue in their disbelief.<br>
52. For verily thou [Muhammad] canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou<br>
make the deaf to hear the call when they have turned to flee.<br>
53. Nor canst thou guide the blind out of their error. Thou canst make none to<br>
hear save those who believe in Our revelations so that they surrender [unto<br>
Him].<br>
54. Allah is He Who shaped you out of weakness, then appointed after weakness<br>
strength, then, after strength, appointed weakness and grey hair. He createth<br>
what He will. He is the Knower, the Mighty.<br>
<br>
193<br>
<br>
55. And on the day when the Hour riseth the guilty will vow that they did tarry<br>
but an hour - thus were they ever deceived.<br>
56. But those to whom knowledge and faith are given will say: The truth is, ye<br>
have tarried, by Allah's decree, until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day<br>
of Resurrection, but ye used not to know.<br>
57. In that day their excuses will not profit those who did injustice, nor will<br>
they be allowed to make amends.<br>
58. Verily We have coined for mankind in this Qur'an all kinds of similitudes;<br>
and indeed if thou camest unto them with a miracle, those who disbelieve would<br>
verily exclaim: Ye are but tricksters!<br>
59. Thus doth Allah seal the hearts of those who know not.<br>
60. So have patience [O Muhammad]! Allah's promise is the very truth, and let<br>
not those who have no certainty make thee impatient.<br>
<br>
SURA 31. LUQMAN (LUQMAN)<br>
1. Alif. Lam. Mim.<br>
2. These are revelations of the wise Scripture,<br>
3. A guidance and a mercy for the good,<br>
4. Those who establish worship and pay the poor-due and have sure faith in the<br>
Hereafter.<br>
5. Such have guidance from their Lord. Such are the successful.<br>
6. And of mankind is he who payeth for mere pastime of discourse, that he may<br>
mislead from Allah's way without knowledge, and maketh it the butt of mockery.<br>
For such there is a shameful doom.<br>
7. And when Our revelations are recited unto him he turneth away in pride as if<br>
he heard them not, as if there were a deafness in his ears. So give him tidings<br>
of a painful doom.<br>
8. Lo! those who believe and do good works, for them are the gardens of delight,<br>
9. Wherein they will abide. It is a promise of Allah in truth. He is the Mighty,<br>
the Wise.<br>
10. He hath created the heavens without supports that ye can see, and hath cast<br>
into the earth firm hills, so that it quake not with you; and He hath dispersed<br>
therein all kinds of beasts. And We send down water from the sky and We cause<br>
[plants] of every goodly kind to grow therein.<br>
11. This is the Creation of Allah. Now show me that which those [ye worship]<br>
beside Him have created. Nay, but the wrong-doers are in error manifest!<br>
12. And verily We gave Luqman wisdom, saying: Give thanks unto Allah; and<br>
whosoever giveth thanks, he giveth thanks for [the good of] his soul. And<br>
whosoever refuseth - Lo! Allah is Absolute, Owner of Praise.<br>
13. And [remember] when Luqman said unto his son, when he was exhorting him: O<br>
my dear son! Ascribe no partners unto Allah. Lo! to ascribe partners [unto Him]<br>
is a tremendous wrong 14. And We have enjoined upon man concerning his partners - His mother beareth<br>
him in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years - Give thanks<br>
unto Me and unto thy parents. Unto Me is the journeying.<br>
<br>
194<br>
<br>
15. But if they strive with thee to make thee ascribe unto Me as partner that of<br>
which thou hast no knowledge, then obey them not. Consort with them in the world<br>
kindly, and follow the path of him who repenteth unto Me. Then unto Me will be<br>
your return, and I shall tell you what ye used to do 16. O my dear son! Lo! though it be but the weight of a grain of mustard-seed,<br>
and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, Allah will bring<br>
it forth. Lo! Allah is Subtile, Aware.<br>
17. O my dear son! Establish worship and enjoin kindness and forbid iniquity,<br>
and persevere whatever may befall thee. Lo! that is of the steadfast heart of<br>
things.<br>
18. Turn not thy cheek in scorn toward folk, nor walk with pertness in the land.<br>
Lo! Allah loveth not each braggart boaster.<br>
19. Be modest in thy bearing and subdue thy voice. Lo! the harshest of all<br>
voices is the voice of the ass.<br>
20. See ye not how Allah hath made serviceable unto you whatsoever is in the<br>
skies and whatsoever is in the earth and hath loaded you with His favours both<br>
without and within? Yet of mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah, without<br>
knowledge or guidance or a scripture giving light.<br>
21. And if it be said unto them: Follow that which Allah hath revealed, they<br>
say: Nay, but we follow that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even though the<br>
devil were inviting them unto the doom of flame?<br>
22. Whosoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good, he verily hath<br>
grasped the firm hand-hold. Unto Allah belongeth the sequel of all things.<br>
23. And whosoever disbelieveth, let not his disbelief afflict thee [O Muhammad].<br>
Unto Us is their return, and We shall tell them what they did. Lo! Allah is<br>
Aware of what is in the breasts [of men].<br>
24. We give them comfort for a little, and then We drive them to a heavy doom.<br>
25. If thou shouldst ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth? they would<br>
answer: Allah. Say: Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not.<br>
26. Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. Lo! Allah,<br>
He is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise.<br>
27. And if all the trees in the earth were pens, and the sea, with seven more<br>
seas to help it, [were ink], the words of Allah could not be exhausted. Lo!<br>
Allah is Mighty, Wise.<br>
28. Your creation and your raising [from the dead] are only as [the creation and<br>
the raising of] a single soul. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower.<br>
29. Hast thou not seen how Allah causeth the night to pass into the day and<br>
causeth the day to pass into the night, and hath subdued the sun and the moon<br>
[to do their work], each running unto an appointed term; and that Allah is<br>
Informed of what ye do?<br>
30. That [is so] because Allah, He is the True, and that which they invoke<br>
beside Him is the False, and because Allah, He is the Sublime, the Great.<br>
31. Hast thou not seen how the ships glide on the sea by Allah's grace, that He<br>
may show you of His wonders? Lo! therein indeed are portents for every<br>
steadfast, grateful [heart].<br>
32. And if a wave enshroudeth them like awnings, they cry unto Allah, making<br>
their faith pure for Him only. But when He bringeth them safe to land, some of<br>
them compromise. None denieth Our signs save every traitor ingrate.<br>
195<br>
<br>
33. O mankind! Keep your duty to your Lord and fear a Day when the parent will<br>
not be able to avail the child in aught, nor the child to avail the parent. Lo!<br>
Allah's promise is the very truth. Let not the life of the world beguile you,<br>
nor let the deceiver beguile you, in regard to Allah.<br>
34. Lo! Allah! With Him is knowledge of the Hour. He sendeth down the rain, and<br>
knoweth that which is in the wombs. No soul knoweth what it will earn to-morrow,<br>
and no soul knoweth in what land it will die. Lo! Allah is Knower, Aware.<br>
<br>
SURA 32. AS-SAJDA (THE PROSTRATION,WORSHIP,<br>
ADORATION)<br>
1. Alif. Lam. Mim<br>
2. The revelation of the Scripture whereof there is no doubt is from the Lord of<br>
the Worlds.<br>
3. Or say they: He hath invented it? Nay, but it is the Truth from thy Lord,<br>
that thou mayst warn a folk to whom no warner came before thee, that haply they<br>
may walk aright.<br>
4. Allah it is Who created the heavens and the earth, and that which is between<br>
them, in six Days. Then He mounted the Throne. Ye have not, beside Him, a<br>
protecting friend or mediator. Will ye not then remember?<br>
5. He directeth the ordinance from the heaven unto the earth; then it ascendeth<br>
unto Him in a Day, whereof the measure is a thousand years of that ye reckon.<br>
6. Such is the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, the Mighty, the<br>
Merciful,<br>
7. Who made all things good which He created, and He began the creation of man<br>
from clay;<br>
8. Then He made his seed from a draught of despised fluid;<br>
9. Then He fashioned him and breathed into him of His Spirit; and appointed for<br>
you hearing and sight and hearts. Small thanks give ye!<br>
10. And they say: When we are lost in the earth, how can we then be re-created?<br>
Nay but they are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord.<br>
11. Say: The angel of death, who hath charge concerning you, will gather you,<br>
and afterward unto your Lord ye will be returned.<br>
12. Couldst thou but see when the guilty hang their heads before their Lord,<br>
[and say]: Our Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back; we will do<br>
right, now we are sure.<br>
13. And if We had so willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but<br>
the word from Me concerning evildoers took effect: that I will fill hell with<br>
the jinn and mankind together.<br>
14. So taste [the evil of your deeds]. Forasmuch as ye forgot the meeting of<br>
this your day, lo! We forget you. Taste the doom of immortality because of what<br>
ye used to do.<br>
15. Only those believe in Our revelations who, when they are reminded of them,<br>
fall down prostrate and hymn the praise of their Lord, and they are not<br>
scornful,<br>
<br>
196<br>
<br>
16. Who forsake their beds to cry unto their Lord in fear and hope, and spend of<br>
that We have bestowed on them.<br>
17. No soul knoweth what is kept hid for them of joy, as a reward for what they<br>
used to do.<br>
18. Is he who is a believer like unto him who is an evil-liver? They are not<br>
alike.<br>
19. But as for those who believe and do good works, for them are the Gardens of<br>
Retreat - a welcome [in reward] for what they used to do.<br>
20. And as for those who do evil, their retreat is the Fire. Whenever they<br>
desire to issue forth from thence, they are brought back thither. Unto them it<br>
is said: Taste the torment of the Fire which ye used to deny.<br>
21. And verily We make them taste the lower punishment before the greater, that<br>
haply they may return.<br>
22. And who doth greater wrong than he who is reminded of the revelations of his<br>
Lord, then turneth from them. Lo! We shall requite the guilty.<br>
23. We verily gave Moses the Scripture; so be not ye in doubt of his receiving<br>
it; and We appointed it a guidance for the Children of Israel.<br>
24. And when they became steadfast and believed firmly in Our revelations, We<br>
appointed from among them leaders who guided by Our command.<br>
25. Lo! thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning<br>
that wherein they used to differ.<br>
26. Is it not a guidance for them [to observe] how many generations We destroyed<br>
before them, amid whose dwelling places they do walk? Lo! therein verily are<br>
portents! Will they not then heed?<br>
27. Have they not seen how We lead the water to the barren land and therewith<br>
bring forth crops whereof their cattle eat, and they themselves? Will they not<br>
then see?<br>
28. And they say: When cometh this victory [of yours] if ye are truthful?<br>
29. Say [unto them]: On the day of the victory the faith of those who disbelieve<br>
[and who then will believe] will not avail them, neither will they be reprieved.<br>
30. So withdraw from them [O Muhammad], and await [the event]. Lo! they [also]<br>
are awaiting [it].<br>
<br>
SURA 33. AL-AHZAB (THE CLANS, THE COALITION,THE<br>
COMBINED FORCES)<br>
1. O Prophet! Keep thy duty to Allah and obey not the disbelievers and the<br>
hypocrites. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
2. And follow that which is inspired in thee from thy Lord. Lo! Allah is Aware<br>
of what ye do.<br>
3. And put thy trust in Allah, for Allah is sufficient as Trustee.<br>
4. Allah hath not assigned unto any man two hearts within his body, nor hath He<br>
made your wives whom ye declare [to be your mothers] your mothers, nor hath He<br>
made those whom ye claim [to be your sons] your sons. This is but a saying of<br>
your mouths. But Allah saith the truth and He showeth the way.<br>
<br>
197<br>
<br>
5. Proclaim their real parentage. That will be more equitable in the sight of<br>
Allah. And if ye know not their fathers, then [they are] your brethren in the<br>
faith, and your clients. And there is no sin for you in the mistakes that ye<br>
make unintentionally, but what your hearts purpose [that will be a sin for you].<br>
Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
6. The Prophet is closer to the believers than their selves, and his wives are<br>
[as] their mothers. And the owners of kinship are closer one to another in the<br>
ordinance of Allah than [other] believers and the fugitives [who fled from<br>
Mecca], except that ye should do kindness to your friends. This is written in<br>
the Book [of nature].<br>
7. And when We exacted a covenant from the prophets, and from thee [O Muhammad]<br>
and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a<br>
solemn covenant;<br>
8. That He may ask the loyal of their loyalty. And He hath prepared a painful<br>
doom for the unfaithful.<br>
9. O ye who believe! Remember Allah's favour unto you when there came against<br>
you hosts, and We sent against them a great wind and hosts ye could not see. And<br>
Allah is ever Seer of what ye do.<br>
10. When they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when eyes<br>
grew wild and hearts reached to the throats, and ye were imagining vain thoughts<br>
concerning Allah.<br>
11. There were the believers sorely tried, and shaken with a mighty shock.<br>
12. And when the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, were<br>
saying: Allah and His messenger promised us naught but delusion.<br>
13. And when a party of them said: O folk of Yathrib! There is no stand<br>
[possible] for you, therefor turn back. And certain of them [even] sought<br>
permission of the Prophet, saying: Our homes lie open [to the enemy]. And they<br>
lay not open. They but wished to flee.<br>
14. If the enemy had entered from all sides and they had been exhorted to<br>
treachery, they would have committed it, and would have hesitated thereupon but<br>
little.<br>
15. And verily they had already sworn unto Allah that they would not turn their<br>
backs [to the foe]. An oath to Allah must be answered for.<br>
16. Say: Flight will not avail you if ye flee from death or killing, and then ye<br>
dwell in comfort but a little while.<br>
17. Say: Who is he who can preserve you from Allah if He intendeth harm for you,<br>
or intendeth mercy for you. They will not find that they have any friend or<br>
helper other than Allah.<br>
18. Allah already knoweth those of you who hinder, and those who say unto their<br>
brethren: "Come ye hither unto us!" and they come not to the stress of battle<br>
save a little,<br>
19. Being sparing of their help to you [believers]. But when the fear cometh,<br>
then thou [Muhammad] seest them regarding thee with rolling eyes like one who<br>
fainteth unto death. Then, when the fear departeth, they scald you with sharp<br>
tongues in their greed for wealth [from the spoil]. Such have not believed.<br>
Therefor Allah maketh their deeds fruitless. And that is easy for Allah.<br>
20. They hold that the clans have not retired [for good]; and if the clans<br>
should advance [again], they would fain be in the desert with the wandering<br>
<br>
198<br>
<br>
Arabs, asking for the news of you; and if they were among you, they would not<br>
give battle, save a little.<br>
21. Verily in the messenger of Allah ye have a good example for him who looketh<br>
unto Allah and the Last Day, and remembereth Allah much.<br>
22. And when the true believers saw the clans, they said: This is that which<br>
Allah and His messenger promised us. Allah and His messenger are true. It did<br>
but confirm them in their faith and resignation.<br>
23. Of the believers are men who are true to that which they covenanted with<br>
Allah. Some of them have paid their vow by death [in battle], and some of them<br>
still are waiting; and they have not altered in the least;<br>
24. That Allah may reward the true men for their truth, and punish the<br>
hypocrites if He will, or relent toward them [if He will]. Lo! Allah is<br>
Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
25. And Allah repulsed the disbelievers in their wrath; they gained no good.<br>
Allah averted their attack from the believers. Allah is ever Strong, Mighty.<br>
26. And He brought those of the People of the Scripture who supported them down<br>
from their strongholds, and cast panic into their hearts. Some ye slew, and ye<br>
made captive some.<br>
27. And He caused you to inherit their land and their houses and their wealth,<br>
and land ye have not trodden. Allah is ever Able to do all things.<br>
28. O Prophet! Say unto thy wives: If ye desire the world's life and its<br>
adornment, come! I will content you and will release you with a fair release.<br>
29. But if ye desire Allah and His messenger and the abode of the Hereafter,<br>
then lo! Allah hath prepared for the good among you an immense reward.<br>
30. O ye wives of the Prophet! Whosoever of you committeth manifest lewdness,<br>
the punishment for her will be doubled, and that is easy for Allah.<br>
31. And whosoever of you is submissive unto Allah and His messenger and doeth<br>
right, We shall give her her reward twice over, and We have prepared for her a<br>
rich provision.<br>
32. O ye wives of the Prophet! Ye are not like any other women. If ye keep your<br>
duty [to Allah], then be not soft of speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease<br>
aspire [to you], but utter customary speech.<br>
33. And<br>
Time of<br>
and His<br>
Folk of<br>
<br>
stay in your houses. Bedizen not yourselves with the bedizenment of the<br>
Ignorance. Be regular in prayer, and pay the poor-due, and obey Allah<br>
messenger. Allah's wish is but to remove uncleanness far from you, O<br>
the Household, and cleanse you with a thorough cleansing.<br>
<br>
34. And bear in mind that which is recited in your houses of the revelations of<br>
Allah and wisdom. Lo! Allah is Subtile, Aware.<br>
35. Lo! men who surrender unto Allah, and women who surrender, and men who<br>
believe and women who believe, and men who obey and women who obey, and men who<br>
speak the truth and women who speak the truth, and men who persevere [in<br>
righteousness] and women who persevere, and men who are humble and women who are<br>
humble, and men who give alms and women who give alms, and men who fast and<br>
women who fast, and men who guard their modesty and women who guard [their<br>
modesty], and men who remember Allah much and women who remember - Allah hath<br>
prepared for them forgiveness and a vast reward.<br>
36. And it becometh not a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His<br>
messenger have decided an affair [for them], that they should [after that] claim<br>
<br>
199<br>
<br>
any say in their affair; and whoso is rebellious to Allah and His messenger, he<br>
verily goeth astray in error manifest.<br>
37. And when thou saidst unto him on whom Allah hath conferred favour and thou<br>
hast conferred favour: Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear Allah. And thou didst<br>
hide in thy mind that which Allah was to bring to light, and thou didst fear<br>
mankind whereas Allah hath a better right that thou shouldst fear Him. So when<br>
Zeyd had performed that necessary formality [of divorce] from her, We gave her<br>
unto thee in marriage, so that [henceforth] there may be no sin for believers in<br>
respect of wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have performed the<br>
necessary formality [of release] from them. The commandment of Allah must be<br>
fulfilled.<br>
38. There is no reproach for the Prophet in that which Allah maketh his due.<br>
That was Allah's way with those who passed away of old - and the commandment of<br>
Allah is certain destiny 39. Who delivered the messages of Allah and feared Him, and feared none save<br>
Allah. Allah keepeth good account.<br>
40. Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the messenger of<br>
Allah and the Seal of the Prophets; and Allah is ever Aware of all things.<br>
41. O ye who believe! Remember Allah with much remembrance.<br>
42. And glorify Him early and late.<br>
43. He it is Who blesseth you, and His angels [bless you], that He may bring you<br>
forth from darkness unto light; and He is ever Merciful to the believers.<br>
44. Their salutation on the day when they shall meet Him will be: Peace. And He<br>
hath prepared for them a goodly recompense.<br>
45. O Prophet! Lo! We have sent thee as a witness and a bringer of good tidings<br>
and a warner.<br>
46. And as a summoner unto Allah by His permission, and as a lamp that giveth<br>
light.<br>
47. And announce unto the believers the good tidings that they will have great<br>
bounty from Allah.<br>
48. And incline not to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Disregard their<br>
noxious talk, and put thy trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient as Trustee.<br>
49. O ye who believe! If ye wed believing women and divorce them before ye have<br>
touched them, then there is no period that ye should reckon. But content them<br>
and release them handsomely.<br>
50. O Prophet! Lo! We have made lawful unto thee thy wives unto whom thou hast<br>
paid their dowries, and those whom thy right hand possesseth of those whom Allah<br>
hath given thee as spoils of war, and the daughters of thine uncle on the<br>
father's side and the daughters of thine aunts on the father's side, and the<br>
daughters of thine uncle on the mother's side and the daughters of thine aunts<br>
on the mother's side who emigrated with thee, and a believing woman if she give<br>
herself unto the Prophet and the Prophet desire to ask her in marriage - a<br>
privilege for thee only, not for the [rest of] believers - We are Aware of that<br>
which We enjoined upon them concerning their wives and those whom their right<br>
hands possess - that thou mayst be free from blame, for Allah is ever Forgiving,<br>
Merciful.<br>
51. Thou canst defer whom thou wilt of them and receive unto thee whom thou<br>
wilt, and whomsoever thou desirest of those whom thou hast set aside<br>
[temporarily], it is no sin for thee [to receive her again]; that is better;<br>
200<br>
<br>
that they may be comforted and not grieve, and may all be pleased with what thou<br>
givest them. Allah knoweth what is in your hearts [O men], and Allah is ever<br>
Forgiving, Clement.<br>
52. It is not allowed thee to take [other] women henceforth, nor that thou<br>
shouldst change them for other wives even though their beauty pleased thee, save<br>
those whom thy right hand possesseth. And Allah is ever Watcher over all things.<br>
53. O Ye who believe! Enter not the dwellings of the Prophet for a meal without<br>
waiting for the proper time, unless permission be granted you. But if ye are<br>
invited, enter, and, when your meal is ended, then disperse. Linger not for<br>
conversation. Lo! that would cause annoyance to the Prophet, and he would be shy<br>
of [asking] you [to go]; but Allah is not shy of the truth. And when ye ask of<br>
them [the wives of the Prophet] anything, ask it of them from behind a curtain.<br>
That is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. And it is not for you to<br>
cause annoyance to the messenger of Allah, nor that ye should ever marry his<br>
wives after him. Lo! that in Allah's sight would be an enormity.<br>
54. Whether ye divulge a thing or keep it hidden, lo! Allah is ever Knower of<br>
all things.<br>
55. It is no sin for them [thy wives] to converse freely] with their fathers, or<br>
their sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or the sons of their<br>
sisters or of their own women, or their slaves. O women! Keep your duty to<br>
Allah. Lo! Allah is ever Witness over all things.<br>
56. Lo! Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Prophet. O ye who believe!<br>
Ask blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation.<br>
57. Lo! those who malign Allah and His messenger, Allah hath cursed them in the<br>
world and the Hereafter, and hath prepared for them the doom of the disdained.<br>
58. And those who malign believing men and believing women undeservedly, they<br>
bear the guilt of slander and manifest sin.<br>
59. O Prophet! Tell thy wives and thy daughters and the women of the believers<br>
to draw their cloaks close round them [when they go abroad]. That will be<br>
better, so that they may be recognised and not annoyed. Allah is ever Forgiving,<br>
Merciful.<br>
60. If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and the alarmists<br>
in the city do not cease, We verily shall urge thee on against them, then they<br>
will be your neighbours in it but a little while.<br>
61. Accursed, they will be seized wherever found and slain with a [fierce]<br>
slaughter.<br>
62. That was the way of Allah in the case of those who passed away of old; thou<br>
wilt not find for the way of Allah aught of power to change.<br>
63. Men ask thee of the Hour. Say: The knowledge of it is with Allah only. What<br>
can convey [the knowledge] unto thee? It may be that the Hour is nigh.<br>
64. Lo! Allah hath cursed the disbelievers, and hath prepared for them a flaming<br>
fire,<br>
65. Wherein they will abide for ever. They will find [then] no protecting friend<br>
nor helper.<br>
66. On the day when their faces are turned over in the Fire, they say: Oh, would<br>
that we had obeyed Allah and had obeyed His messenger!<br>
67. And they say: Our Lord! Lo! we obeyed our princes and great men, and they<br>
misled us from the Way.<br>
<br>
201<br>
<br>
68. Our Lord! Oh, give them double torment and curse them with a mighty curse.<br>
69. O ye who believe! Be not as those who slandered Moses, but Allah proved his<br>
innocence of that which they alleged, and he was well esteemed in Allah's sight.<br>
70. O ye who believe! Guard your duty to Allah, and speak words straight to the<br>
point;<br>
71. He will adjust your works for you and will forgive you your sins. Whosoever<br>
obeyeth Allah and His messenger, he verily hath gained a signal victory.<br>
72. Lo! We offered the trust unto the heavens and the earth and the hills, but<br>
they shrank from bearing it and were afraid of it. And man assumed it. Lo! he<br>
hath proved a tyrant and a fool.<br>
73. So Allah punisheth hypocritical men and hypocritical women, and idolatrous<br>
men and idolatrous women. But Allah pardoneth believing men and believing women,<br>
and Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
<br>
SURA 34. SABA (SABA, SHEBA)<br>
1. Praise be to Allah, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and<br>
whatsoever is in the earth. His is the praise in the Hereafter, and He is the<br>
Wise, the Aware.<br>
2. He knoweth that which goeth into the earth and that which cometh forth from<br>
it, and that descendeth from the heaven and that which ascendeth into it. He is<br>
the Merciful, the Forgiving.<br>
3. Those who disbelieve say: The Hour will never come unto us. Say: Nay, by my<br>
Lord, but it is coming unto you surely. [He is] the Knower of the Unseen. Not an<br>
atom's weight, or less than that or greater, escapeth Him in the heavens or in<br>
the earth, but it is in a clear Record,<br>
4. That He may reward those who believe and do good works. For them is pardon<br>
and a rich provision.<br>
5. But those who strive against Our revelations, challenging [Us], theirs will<br>
be a painful doom of wrath.<br>
6. Those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed unto thee from<br>
thy Lord is the truth and leadeth unto the path of the Mighty, the Owner of<br>
Praise.<br>
7. Those who disbelieve say: Shall we show you a man who will tell you [that]<br>
when ye have become dispersed in dust with most complete dispersal still, even<br>
then, ye will be created anew?<br>
8. Hath he invented a lie concerning Allah, or is there in him a madness? Nay,<br>
but those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are in torment and far error.<br>
9. Have they not observed what is before them and what is behind them of the sky<br>
and the earth? If We will, We can make the earth swallow them, or cause<br>
obliteration from the sky to fall on them. Lo! herein surely is a portent for<br>
every slave who turneth [to Allah] repentant.<br>
10. And assuredly We gave David grace from Us, [saying]: O ye hills and birds,<br>
echo his psalms of praise! And We made the iron supple unto him,<br>
11. Saying: Make thou long coats of mail and measure the links [thereof]. And do<br>
ye right. Lo! I am Seer of what ye do.<br>
<br>
202<br>
<br>
12. And unto Solomon [We gave] the wind, whereof the morning course was a<br>
month's journey and the evening course a month's journey, and We caused the<br>
fount of copper to gush forth for him, and [We gave him] certain of the jinn who<br>
worked before him by permission of his Lord. And such of them as deviated from<br>
Our command, them We caused to taste the punishment of flaming Fire.<br>
13. They made for him what he willed: synagogues and statues, basins like wells<br>
and boilers built into the ground. Give thanks, O House of David! Few of My<br>
bondmen are thankful.<br>
14. And when We decreed death for him, nothing showed his death to them save a<br>
creeping creature of the earth which gnawed away his staff. And when he fell the<br>
jinn saw clearly how, if they had known the Unseen, they would not have<br>
continued in despised toil.<br>
15. There was indeed a sign for Sheba in their dwelling-place: Two gardens on<br>
the right hand and the left [as who should say]: Eat of the provision of your<br>
Lord and render thanks to Him. A fair land and an indulgent Lord!<br>
16. But they were froward, so We sent on them the flood of 'Iram, and in<br>
exchange for their two gardens gave them two gardens bearing bitter fruit, the<br>
tamarisk and here and there a lote-tree.<br>
17. This We awarded them because of their ingratitude. Punish We ever any save<br>
the ingrates?<br>
18. And We set, between them and the towns which We had blessed, towns easy to<br>
be seen, and We made the stage between them easy, [saying]: Travel in them<br>
safely both by night and day.<br>
19. But they said: Our Lord! Make the stage between our journeys longer. And<br>
they wronged themselves, therefore We made them bywords [in the land] and<br>
scattered them abroad, a total scattering. Lo! herein verily are portents for<br>
each steadfast, grateful [heart].<br>
20. And Satan indeed found his calculation true concerning them, for they follow<br>
him, all save a group of true believers.<br>
21. And he had no warrant whatsoever against them, save that We would know him<br>
who believeth in the Hereafter from him who is in doubt thereof; and thy Lord [O<br>
Muhammad] taketh note of all things.<br>
22. Say [O Muhammad]: Call upon those whom ye set up beside Allah! They possess<br>
not an atom's weight either in the heavens or in the earth, nor have they any<br>
share in either, nor hath He an auxiliary among them.<br>
23. No intercession availeth with Him save for him whom He permitteth. Yet, when<br>
fear is banished from their hearts, they say: What was it that your Lord said?<br>
They say: The Truth. And He is the Sublime, the Great.<br>
24. Say: Who giveth you provision from the sky and the earth? Say: Allah, Lo! we<br>
or you assuredly are rightly guided or in error manifest.<br>
25. Say: Ye will not be asked of what we committed, nor shall we be asked of<br>
what ye do.<br>
26. Say: Our Lord will bring us all together, then He will judge between us with<br>
truth. He is the All-knowing Judge.<br>
27. Say: Show me those whom ye have joined unto Him as partners. Nay [ye dare<br>
not]! For He is Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
28. And We have not sent thee [O Muhammad] save as a bringer of good tidings and<br>
a warner unto all mankind; but most of mankind know not.<br>
<br>
203<br>
<br>
29. And they say: When is this promise [to be fulfilled] if ye are truthful?<br>
30. Say [O Muhammad]: Yours is the promise of a Day which ye cannot postpone nor<br>
hasten by an hour.<br>
31. And those who disbelieve say: We believe not in this Qur'an nor in that<br>
which was before it; but oh, if thou couldst see, when the wrong-doers are<br>
brought up before their Lord, how they cast the blame one to another; how those<br>
who were despised [in the earth] say unto those who were proud: But for you, we<br>
should have been believers.<br>
32. Those who were proud say unto those who were despised: Did we drive you away<br>
from the guidance after it had come unto you? Nay, but ye were guilty.<br>
33. Those who were despised say unto those who were proud: Nay but [it was your]<br>
scheming night and day, when ye commanded us to disbelieve in Allah and set up<br>
rivals unto Him. And they are filled with remorse when they behold the doom; and<br>
We place carcans on the necks of those who disbelieved. Are they requited aught<br>
save what they used to do?<br>
34. And We sent not unto any township a warner, but its pampered ones declared:<br>
Lo! we are disbelievers in that wherewith ye have been sent.<br>
35. And they say: We are more [than you] in wealth and children. We are not the<br>
punished!<br>
36. Say [O Muhammad]: Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will and<br>
narroweth it [for whom He will]. But most of mankind know not.<br>
37. And it is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you near unto<br>
Us, but he who believeth and doeth good [he draweth near]. As for such, theirs<br>
will be twofold reward for what they did and they will dwell secure in lofty<br>
halls.<br>
38. And as for those who strive against Our revelations, challenging, they will<br>
be brought to the doom.<br>
39. Say: Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His bondmen,<br>
and narroweth [it] for him. And whatsoever ye spend [for good] He replaceth it.<br>
And He is the Best of Providers.<br>
40. And on the day when He will gather them all together, He will say unto the<br>
angels: Did these worship you?<br>
41. They will say: Be Thou Glorified. Thou [alone] art our Guardian, not them!<br>
Nay, but they worshipped the jinn; most of them were believers in them.<br>
42. That day ye will possess no use nor hurt one for another. And We shall say<br>
unto those who did wrong: Taste the doom of the Fire which ye used to deny.<br>
43. And if Our revelations are recited unto them in plain terms, they say: This<br>
is naught else than a man who would turn you away from what your fathers used to<br>
worship; and they say: This is naught else than an invented lie. Those who<br>
disbelieve say of the truth when it reacheth them: This is naught else than mere<br>
magic.<br>
44. And We have given them no scriptures which they study, nor sent We unto<br>
them, before thee, any warner.<br>
45. Those before them denied, and these have not attained a tithe of that which<br>
We bestowed on them [of old]; yet they denied My messengers. How intense then<br>
was My abhorrence [of them]!<br>
46. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: I exhort you unto one thing only: that ye<br>
awake, for Allah's sake, by twos and singly, and then reflect: There is no<br>
204<br>
<br>
madness in your comrade. He is naught else than a warner unto you in face of a<br>
terrific doom.<br>
47. Say: Whatever reward I might have asked of you is yours. My reward is the<br>
affair of Allah only. He is Witness over all things.<br>
48. Say: Lo! my Lord hurleth the truth. [He is] the Knower of Things Hidden.<br>
49. Say: The Truth hath come, and falsehood showeth not its face and will not<br>
return.<br>
50. Say: If I err, I err only to my own loss, and if I am rightly guided it is<br>
because of that which my Lord hath revealed unto me. Lo! He is Hearer, Nigh.<br>
51. Couldst thou but see when they are terrified with no escape, and are seized<br>
from near at hand,<br>
52. And say: We [now] believe therein. But how can they reach [faith] from afar<br>
off,<br>
53. When they disbelieved in it of yore. They aim at the unseen from afar off.<br>
54. And a gulf is set between them and that which they desire, as was done for<br>
people of their kind of old. Lo! they were in hopeless doubt.<br>
<br>
SURA 35. FATIR (THE ANGELS, ORIGNATOR)<br>
1. Praise be to Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, Who appointeth<br>
the angels messengers having wings two, three and four. He multiplieth in<br>
creation what He will. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
2. That which Allah openeth unto mankind of mercy none can withhold it; and that<br>
which He withholdeth none can release thereafter. He is the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
3. O mankind! Remember Allah's grace toward you! Is there any creator other than<br>
Allah who provideth for you from the sky and the earth? There is no Allah save<br>
Him. Whither then are ye turned?<br>
4. And if they deny thee, [O Muhammad], messengers [of Allah] were denied before<br>
thee. Unto Allah all things are brought back.<br>
5. O mankind! Lo! the promise of Allah is true. So let not the life of the world<br>
beguile you, and let not the [avowed] beguiler beguile you with regard to Allah.<br>
6. Lo! the devil is an enemy for you, so treat him as an enemy. He only<br>
summoneth his faction to be owners of the flaming Fire.<br>
7. Those who disbelieve, theirs will be an awful doom; and those who believe and<br>
do good works, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward.<br>
8. Is he, the evil of whose deeds is made fairseeming unto him so that he<br>
deemeth it good, [other than Satan's dupe]? Allah verily sendeth whom He will<br>
astray, and guideth whom He will; so let not thy soul expire in sighings for<br>
them. Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do!<br>
9. And Allah it is Who sendeth the winds and they raise a cloud; then We lead it<br>
unto a dead land and revive therewith the earth after its death. Such is the<br>
Resurrection.<br>
10. Whoso desireth power [should know that] all power belongeth to Allah. Unto<br>
Him good words ascend, and the pious deed doth He exalt; but those who plot<br>
iniquities, theirs will be an awful doom; and the plotting of such [folk] will<br>
come to naught.<br>
<br>
205<br>
<br>
11. Allah created you from dust, then from a little fluid, then He made you<br>
pairs [the male and female]. No female beareth or bringeth forth save with His<br>
knowledge. And no-one groweth old who groweth old, nor is aught lessened of his<br>
life, but it is recorded in a Book, Lo! that is easy for Allah.<br>
12. And the two seas are not alike: this, fresh, sweet, good to drink, this<br>
[other] bitter, salt. And from them both ye eat fresh meat and derive the<br>
ornament that ye wear. And thou seest the ship cleaving them with its prow that<br>
ye may seek of His bounty, and that haply ye may give thanks.<br>
13. He maketh the night to pass into the day and He maketh the day to pass into<br>
the night. He hath subdued the sun and moon to service. Each runneth unto an<br>
appointed term. Such is Allah, your Lord; His is the Sovereignty; and those unto<br>
whom ye pray instead of Him own not so much as the white spot on a date-stone.<br>
14. If ye pray unto them they hear not your prayer, and if they heard they could<br>
not grant it you. On the Day of Resurrection they will disown association with<br>
you. None can inform you like Him Who is Aware.<br>
15. O mankind! Ye are the poor in your relation to Allah. And Allah! He is the<br>
Absolute, the Owner of Praise.<br>
16. If He will, He can be rid of you and bring [instead of you] some new<br>
creation.<br>
17. That is not a hard thing for Allah.<br>
18. And no burdened soul can bear another's burden, and if one heavy laden<br>
crieth for [help with] his load, naught of it will be lifted even though he<br>
[unto whom he crieth] be of kin. Thou warnest only those who fear their Lord in<br>
secret, and have established worship. He who groweth [in goodness], groweth only<br>
for himself, [he cannot by his merit redeem others]. Unto Allah is the<br>
journeying.<br>
19. The blind man is not equal with the seer;<br>
20. Nor is darkness [tantamount to] light;<br>
21. Nor is the shadow equal with the sun's full heat;<br>
22. Nor are the living equal with the dead. Lo! Allah maketh whom He will to<br>
hear. Thou canst not reach those who are in the graves.<br>
23. Thou art but a warner.<br>
24. Lo! We have sent thee with the Truth, a bearer of glad tidings and a warner;<br>
and there is not a nation but a warner hath passed among them.<br>
25. And if they deny thee, those before them also denied. Their messengers came<br>
unto them with clear proofs [of Allah's Sovereignty], and with the Psalms and<br>
the Scripture giving light.<br>
26. Then seized I those who disbelieved, and how intense was My abhorrence!<br>
27. Hast thou not seen that Allah causeth water to fall from the sky, and We<br>
produce therewith fruit of divers hues; and among the hills are streaks white<br>
and red, of divers hues, and [others] raven-black;<br>
28. And of men and beasts and cattle, in like manner, divers hues? The erudite<br>
among His bondmen fear Allah alone. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Forgiving.<br>
29. Lo! those who read the Scripture of Allah, and establish worship, and spend<br>
of that which We have bestowed on them secretly and openly, they look forward to<br>
imperishable gain,<br>
<br>
206<br>
<br>
30. That He will pay them their wages and increase them of His grace. Lo! He is<br>
Forgiving, Responsive.<br>
31. As for that which We inspire in thee of the Scripture, it is the Truth<br>
confirming that which was [revealed] before it. Lo! Allah is indeed Observer,<br>
Seer of His slaves.<br>
32. Then We gave the Scripture as inheritance unto those whom We elected of Our<br>
bondmen. But of them are some who wrong themselves and of them are some who are<br>
lukewarm, and of them are some who outstrip [others] through good deeds, by<br>
Allah's leave. That is the great favour!<br>
33. Gardens of Eden! They enter them wearing armlets of gold and pearl and their<br>
raiment therein is silk.<br>
34. And they say: Praise be to Allah Who hath put grief away from us. Lo! Our<br>
Lord is Forgiving, Bountiful,<br>
35. Who, of His grace, hath installed us in the mansion of eternity, where toil<br>
toucheth us not nor can weariness affect us.<br>
36. But as for those who disbelieve, for them is fire of hell; it taketh not<br>
complete effect upon them so that they can die, nor is its torment lightened for<br>
them. Thus We punish every ingrate.<br>
37. And they cry for help there, [saying]: Our Lord! Release us; we will do<br>
right, not [the wrong] that we used to do. Did not We grant you a life long<br>
enough for him who reflected to reflect therein? And the warner came unto you.<br>
Now taste [the flavour of your deeds], for evil-doers have no helper.<br>
38. Lo! Allah is the Knower of the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. Lo! He<br>
is Aware of the secret of [men's] breasts.<br>
39. He it is Who hath made you regents in the earth; so he who disbelieveth, his<br>
disbelief be on his own head. Their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers,<br>
in their Lord's sight, naught save abhorrence. Their disbelief increaseth for<br>
the disbelievers naught save loss.<br>
40. Say: Have ye seen your partner-gods to whom ye pray beside Allah? Show me<br>
what they created of the earth! Or have they any portion in the heavens? Or have<br>
We given them a scripture so they act on clear proof therefrom? Nay, the evildoers promise one another only to deceive.<br>
41. Lo! Allah graspeth the heavens and the earth that they deviate not, and if<br>
they were to deviate there is not one that could grasp them after Him. Lo! He is<br>
ever Clement, Forgiving.<br>
42. And they swore by Allah, their most binding oath, that if a warner came unto<br>
them they would be more tractable than any of the nations; yet, when a warner<br>
came unto them it aroused in them naught save repugnance,<br>
43. [Shown in their] behaving arrogantly in the land and plotting evil; and the<br>
evil plot encloseth but the men who make it. Then, can they expect aught save<br>
the treatment of the folk of old? Thou wilt not find for Allah's way of<br>
treatment any substitute, nor wilt thou find for Allah's way of treatment aught<br>
of power to change.<br>
44. Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence<br>
for those who were before them, and they were mightier than these in power?<br>
Allah is not such that aught in the heavens or in the earth escapeth Him. Lo! He<br>
is the Wise, the Mighty.<br>
45. If Allah took mankind to task by that which they deserve, He would not leave<br>
a living creature on the surface of the earth; but He reprieveth them unto an<br>
207<br>
<br>
appointed term, and when their term cometh - then verily [they will know that]<br>
Allah is ever Seer of His slaves.<br>
<br>
SURA 36. YA-SEEN (YA-SEEN)<br>
1. Ya Sin.<br>
2. By the wise Qur'an,<br>
3. Lo! thou art of those sent<br>
4. On a straight path,<br>
5. A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful,<br>
6. That thou mayst warn a folk whose fathers were not warned, so they are<br>
heedless.<br>
7. Already hath the judgment, [for their infidelity] proved true of most of<br>
them, for they believe not.<br>
8. Lo! We have put on their necks carcans reaching unto the chins, so that they<br>
are made stiff-necked.<br>
9. And We have set a bar before them and a bar behind them, and [thus] have<br>
covered them so that they see not.<br>
10. Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not, it is alike for them, for they<br>
believe not.<br>
11. Thou warnest only him who followeth the Reminder and feareth the Beneficent<br>
in secret. To him bear tidings of forgiveness and a rich reward.<br>
12. Lo! We it is Who bring the dead to life. We record that which they send<br>
before [them, and their footprints. And all things We have kept in a clear<br>
Register.<br>
13. Coin for them a similitude: The people of the city when those sent [from<br>
Allah] came unto them;<br>
14. When We sent unto them twain, and they denied them both, so We reinforced<br>
them with a third, and they said: Lo! we have been sent unto you.<br>
15. They said: Ye are but mortals like unto us. The Beneficent hath naught<br>
revealed. Ye do but lie!<br>
16. They answered: Our Lord knoweth that we are indeed sent unto you,<br>
17. And our duty is but plain conveyance [of the message].<br>
18. [The people of the city] said: We augur ill of you. If ye desist not, we<br>
shall surely stone you, and grievous torture will befall you at our hands.<br>
19. They said: Your evil augury be with you! Is it because ye are reminded [of<br>
the truth]? Nay, but ye are froward folk!<br>
20. And there came from the uttermost part of the city a man running. He cried:<br>
O my people! Follow those who have been sent!<br>
21. Follow those who ask of you no fee, and who are rightly guided.<br>
22. For what cause should I not serve Him Who hath created me, and unto Whom ye<br>
will be brought back?<br>
23. Shall I take [other] gods in place of Him when, if the Beneficent should<br>
wish me any harm, their intercession will avail me naught, nor can they save?<br>
<br>
208<br>
<br>
24. Then truly I should be in error manifest.<br>
25. Lo! I have believed in your Lord, so hear me!<br>
26. It was said [unto him]: Enter paradise. He said: Would that my people knew<br>
27. With what [munificence] my Lord hath pardoned me and made me of the honoured<br>
ones!<br>
28. We sent not down against his people after him a host from heaven, nor do We<br>
ever send.<br>
29. It was but one Shout, and lo! they were extinct.<br>
30. Ah, the anguish for the bondmen! Never came there unto them a messenger but<br>
they did mock him!<br>
31. Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which<br>
indeed returned not unto them;<br>
32. But all, without exception, will be brought before Us.<br>
33. A token unto them is the dead earth. We revive it, and We bring forth from<br>
it grain so that they eat thereof;<br>
34. And We have placed therein gardens of the date-palm and grapes, and We have<br>
caused springs of water to gush forth therein,<br>
35. That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands made it not. Will<br>
they not, then, give thanks?<br>
36. Glory be to Him Who created all the sexual pairs, of that which the earth<br>
groweth, and of themselves, and of that which they know not!<br>
37. A token unto them is night. We strip it of the day, and lo! they are in<br>
darkness.<br>
38. And the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him. That is the measuring<br>
of the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
39. And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old<br>
shrivelled palm-leaf.<br>
40. It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the<br>
day. They float each in an orbit.<br>
41. And a token unto them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship,<br>
42. And have created for them of the like thereof whereon they ride.<br>
43. And if We will, We drown them, and there is no help for them, neither can<br>
they be saved;<br>
44. Unless by mercy from Us and as comfort for a while.<br>
45. When it is said unto them: Beware of that which is before you and that which<br>
is behind you, that haply ye may find mercy [they are heedless].<br>
46. Never came a token of the tokens of their Lord to them, but they did turn<br>
away from it!<br>
47. And when it is said unto them: Spend of that wherewith Allah hath provided<br>
you, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Shall we feed those whom<br>
Allah, if He willed, would feed? Ye are in naught else than error manifest.<br>
48. And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful?<br>
49. They await but one Shout, which will surprise them while they are disputing.<br>
<br>
209<br>
<br>
50. Then they cannot make bequest, nor can they return to their own folk.<br>
51. And the trumpet is blown and lo! from the graves they hie unto their Lord,<br>
52. Crying: Woe upon us! Who hath raised us from our place of sleep? This is<br>
that which the Beneficent did promise, and the messengers spoke truth.<br>
53. It is but one Shout, and behold them brought together before Us!<br>
54. This day no soul is wronged in aught; nor are ye requited aught save what ye<br>
used to do.<br>
55. Lo! those who merit paradise this day are happily employed,<br>
56. They and their wives, in pleasant shade, on thrones reclining;<br>
57. Theirs the fruit [of their good deeds] and theirs [all] that they ask;<br>
58. The word from a Merciful Lord [for them] is: Peace!<br>
59. But avaunt ye, O ye guilty, this day!<br>
60. Did I not charge you, O ye sons of Adam, that ye worship not the devil - Lo!<br>
he is your open foe! 61. But that ye worship Me? That was the right path.<br>
62. Yet he hath led astray of you a great multitude. Had ye then no sense?<br>
63. This is hell which ye were promised [if ye followed him].<br>
64. Burn therein this day for that ye disbelieved.<br>
65. This day We seal up their mouths, and their hands speak out to Us and their<br>
feet bear witness as to what they used to earn.<br>
66. And had We willed, We verily could have quenched their eyesight so that they<br>
should struggle for the way. Then how could they have seen?<br>
67. And had We willed, We verily could have fixed them in their place, making<br>
them powerless to go forward or turn back.<br>
68. He whom we bring unto old age, We reverse him in creation [making him go<br>
back to weakness after strength]. Have ye then no sense?<br>
69. And We have not taught him [Muhammad] poetry, nor is it meet for him. This<br>
is naught else than a Reminder and a Lecture making plain,<br>
70. To warn whosoever liveth, and that the word may be fulfilled against the<br>
disbelievers.<br>
71. Have they not seen how We have created for them of Our handiwork the cattle,<br>
so that they are their owners,<br>
72. And have subdued them unto them, so that some of them they have for riding,<br>
some for food?<br>
73. Benefits and [divers] drinks have they from them. Will they not then give<br>
thanks?<br>
74. And they have taken [other] gods beside Allah, in order that they may be<br>
helped.<br>
75. It is not in their power to help them; but they [the worshippers] are unto<br>
them a host in arms.<br>
76. So let not their speech grieve thee [O Muhammad]. Lo! We know what they<br>
conceal and what proclaim.<br>
<br>
210<br>
<br>
77. Hath not man seen that We have created him from a drop of seed? Yet lo! he<br>
is an open opponent.<br>
78. And he hath coined for Us a similitude, and hath forgotten the fact of his<br>
creation, saying: Who will revive these bones when they have rotted away?<br>
79. Say: He will revive them Who produced them at the first, for He is Knower of<br>
every creation,<br>
80. Who hath appointed for you fire from the green tree, and behold! ye kindle<br>
from it.<br>
81. Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the like of<br>
them? Aye, that He is! for He is the All-Wise Creator,<br>
82. But His command, when He intendeth a thing, is only that He saith unto it:<br>
Be! and it is.<br>
83. Therefor Glory be to Him in Whose hand is the dominion over all things! Unto<br>
Him ye will be brought back.<br>
<br>
SURA 37. AS-SAAFFAT (THOSE WHO SET THE RANKS,DRAWN<br>
UP IN RANKS)<br>
1. By those who set the ranks in battle order<br>
2. And those who drive away [the wicked] with reproof<br>
3. And those who read [the Word] for a reminder,<br>
4. Lo! thy Lord is surely One;<br>
5. Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them, and Lord<br>
of the sun's risings.<br>
6. Lo! We have adorned the lowest heaven with an ornament, the planets;<br>
7. With security from every froward devil.<br>
8. They cannot listen to the Highest Chiefs for they are pelted from every side,<br>
9. Outcast, and theirs is a perpetual torment;<br>
10. Save him who snatcheth a fragment, and there pursueth him a piercing flame.<br>
11. Then ask them [O Muhammad]: Are they stronger as a creation, or those<br>
[others] whom we have created? Lo! We created them of plastic clay.<br>
12. Nay, but thou dost marvel when they mock<br>
13. And heed not when they are reminded,<br>
14. And seek to scoff when they behold a portent.<br>
15. And they say: Lo! this is mere magic;<br>
16. When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth, be<br>
raised [again]?<br>
17. And our forefathers?<br>
18. Say [O Muhammad]: Ye, in truth; and ye will be brought low.<br>
19. There is but one Shout, and lo! they behold,<br>
20. And say: Ah, woe for us! This is the Day of Judgment.<br>
<br>
211<br>
<br>
21. This is the Day of Separation, which ye used to deny.<br>
22. [And it is said unto the angels]: Assemble those who did wrong, together<br>
with their wives and what they used to worship<br>
23. Instead of Allah, and lead them to the path to hell;<br>
24. And stop them, for they must be questioned.<br>
25. What aileth you that ye help not one another?<br>
26. Nay, but this day they make full submission.<br>
27. And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning.<br>
28. They say: Lo! ye used to come unto us, imposing, [swearing that ye spoke the<br>
truth].<br>
29. They answer: Nay, but ye [yourselves] were not believers.<br>
30. We had no power over you, but ye were wayward folk.<br>
31. Now the Word of our Lord hath been fulfilled concerning us. Lo! we are about<br>
to taste [the doom].<br>
32. Thus we misled you. Lo! we were [ourselves] astray.<br>
33. Then lo! this day they [both] are sharers in the doom.<br>
34. Lo! thus deal We with the guilty.<br>
35. For when it was said unto them, There is no Allah save Allah, they were<br>
scornful<br>
36. And said: Shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet?<br>
37. Nay, but he brought the Truth, and he confirmed those sent [before him].<br>
38. Lo! [now] verily ye taste the painful doom 39. Ye are requited naught save what ye did 40. Save single-minded slaves of Allah;<br>
41. For them there is a known provision,<br>
42. Fruits. And they will be honoured<br>
43. In the Gardens of delight,<br>
44. On couches facing one another;<br>
45. A cup from a gushing spring is brought round for them,<br>
46. White, delicious to the drinkers,<br>
47. Wherein there is no headache nor are they made mad thereby.<br>
48. And with them are those of modest gaze, with lovely eyes,<br>
49. [Pure] as they were hidden eggs [of the ostrich].<br>
50. And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning.<br>
51. A speaker of them saith: Lo! I had a comrade<br>
52. Who used to say: Art thou in truth of those who put faith [in his words]?<br>
53. Can we, when we are dead and have become mere dust and bones - can we [then]<br>
verily be brought to book?<br>
54. He saith: Will ye look?<br>
<br>
212<br>
<br>
55. Then looketh he and seeth him in the depth of hell.<br>
56. He saith: By Allah, thou verily didst all but cause my ruin,<br>
57. And had it not been for the favour of my Lord, I too had been of those haled<br>
forth [to doom].<br>
58. Are we then not to die<br>
59. Saving our former death, and are we not to be punished?<br>
60. Lo! this is the supreme triumph.<br>
61. For the like of this, then, let the workers work.<br>
62. Is this better as a welcome, or the tree of Zaqqum?<br>
63. Lo! We have appointed it a torment for wrong-doers.<br>
64. Lo! it is a tree that springeth in the heart of hell.<br>
65. Its crop is as it were the heads of devils<br>
66. And lo! they verily must eat thereof, and fill [their] bellies therewith.<br>
67. And afterward, lo! thereupon they have a drink of boiling water<br>
68. And afterward, lo! their return is surely unto hell.<br>
69. They indeed found their fathers astray,<br>
70. But they make haste [to follow] in their footsteps.<br>
71. And verily most of the men of old went astray before them,<br>
72. And verily We sent among them warners.<br>
73. Then see the nature of the consequence for those warned,<br>
74. Save single-minded slaves of Allah.<br>
75. And Noah verily prayed unto Us, and gracious was the Hearer of his prayer<br>
76. And We saved him and his household from the great distress,<br>
77. And made his seed the survivors,<br>
78. And left for him among the later folk [the salutation]:<br>
79. Peace be unto Noah among the peoples!<br>
80. Lo! thus do We reward the good.<br>
81. Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves.<br>
82. Then We did drown the others.<br>
83. And lo! of his persuasion verily was Abraham<br>
84. When he came unto his Lord with a whole heart;<br>
85. When he said unto his father and his folk: What is it that ye worship?<br>
86. Is it a falsehood - gods beside Allah - that ye desire?<br>
87. What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds?<br>
88. And he glanced a glance at the stars<br>
89. Then said: Lo! I feel sick!<br>
90. And they turned their backs and went away from him.<br>
91. Then turned he to their gods and said: Will ye not eat?<br>
213<br>
<br>
92. What aileth you that ye speak not?<br>
93. Then he attacked them, striking with his right hand.<br>
94. And [his people] came toward him, hastening.<br>
95. He said: Worship ye that which ye yourselves do carve<br>
96. When Allah hath created you and what ye make?<br>
97. They said: Build for him a building and fling him in the red-hotfire.<br>
98. And they designed a snare for him, but We made them the undermost.<br>
99. And he said: Lo! I am going unto my Lord Who will guide me.<br>
100. My Lord! Vouchsafe me of the righteous.<br>
101. So We gave him tidings of a gentle son.<br>
102. And when [his son] was old enough to walk with him, [Abraham] said: O my<br>
dear son, I have seen in a dream that I must sacrifice thee. So look, what<br>
thinkest thou? He said: O my father! Do that which thou art commanded. Allah<br>
willing, thou shalt find me of the steadfast.<br>
103. Then, when they had both surrendered [to Allah], and he had flung him down<br>
upon his face,<br>
104. We called unto him: O Abraham!<br>
105. Thou hast already fulfilled the vision. Lo! thus do We reward the good.<br>
106. Lo! that verily was a clear test.<br>
107. Then We ransomed him with a tremendous victim.<br>
108. And We left for him among the later folk [the salutation]:<br>
109. Peace be unto Abraham!<br>
110. Thus do We reward the good.<br>
111. Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves.<br>
112. And we gave him tidings of the birth of Isaac, a prophet of the righteous.<br>
113. And We blessed him and Isaac. And of their seed are some who do good, and<br>
some who plainly wrong themselves.<br>
114. And We verily gave grace unto Moses and Aaron,<br>
115. And saved them and their people from the great distress,<br>
116. And helped them so that they became the victors.<br>
117. And We gave them the clear Scripture<br>
118. And showed them the right path.<br>
119. And We left for them among the later folk [the salutation]:<br>
120. Peace be unto Moses and Aaron!<br>
121. Lo! thus do We reward the good.<br>
122. Lo! they are two of Our believing slaves.<br>
123. And lo! Elias was of those sent [to warn],<br>
124. When he said unto his folk: Will ye not ward off [evil]?<br>
125. Will ye cry unto Baal and forsake the Best of creators,<br>
<br>
214<br>
<br>
126. Allah, your Lord and Lord of your forefathers?<br>
127. But they denied him, so they surely will be haled forth [to the doom]<br>
128. Save single-minded slaves of Allah.<br>
129. And we left for him among the later folk [the salutation]:<br>
130. Peace be unto Elias!<br>
131. Lo! thus do We reward the good.<br>
132. Lo! he is one of our believing slaves.<br>
133. And lo! Lot verily was of those sent [to warn].<br>
134. When We saved him and his household, every one,<br>
135. Save an old woman among those who stayed behind;<br>
136. Then We destroyed the others.<br>
137. And lo! ye verily pass by [the ruin of] them in the morning<br>
138. And at night-time; have ye then no sense?<br>
139. And lo! Jonah verily was of those sent [to warn]<br>
140. When he fled unto the laden ship,<br>
141. And then drew lots and was of those rejected;<br>
142. And the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy;<br>
143. And had he not been one of those who glorify [Allah]<br>
144. He would have tarried in its belly till the day when they are raised;<br>
145. Then We cast him on a desert shore while he was sick;<br>
146. And We caused a tree of gourd to grow above him;<br>
147. And We sent him to a hundred thousand [folk] or more<br>
148. And they believed, therefor We gave them comfort for a while.<br>
149. Now ask them [O Muhammad]: Hath thy Lord daughters whereas they have sons?<br>
150. Or created We the angels females while they were present?<br>
151. Lo! it is of their falsehood that they say:<br>
152. Allah hath begotten. Allah! verily they tell a lie.<br>
153. [And again of their falsehood]: He hath preferred daughters to sons.<br>
154. What aileth you? How judge ye?<br>
155. Will ye not then reflect?<br>
156. Or have ye a clear warrant?<br>
157. Then produce your writ, if ye are truthful.<br>
158. And they imagine kinship between him and the jinn, whereas the jinn know<br>
well that they will be brought before [Him].<br>
159. Glorified be Allah from that which they attribute [unto Him],<br>
160. Save single-minded slaves of Allah.<br>
161. Lo! verily, ye and that which ye worship,<br>
162. Ye cannot excite [anyone] against Him.<br>
215<br>
<br>
163. Save him who is to burn in hell.<br>
164. There is not one of us but hath his known position.<br>
165. Lo! we, even we are they who set the ranks,<br>
166. Lo! we, even we are they who hymn His praise<br>
167. And indeed they used to say:<br>
168. If we had but a reminder from the men of old<br>
169. We would be single-minded slaves of Allah.<br>
170. Yet [now that it is come] they disbelieve therein; but they will come to<br>
know.<br>
171. And verily Our word went forth of old unto Our bondmen sent [to warn]<br>
172. That they verily would be helped,<br>
173. And that Our host, they verily would be the victors.<br>
174. So withdraw from them [O Muhammad] awhile,<br>
175. And watch, for they will [soon] see.<br>
176. Would they hasten on Our doom?<br>
177. But when it cometh home to them, then it will be a hapless morn for those<br>
who have been warned.<br>
178. Withdraw from them awhile<br>
179. And watch, for they will [soon] see.<br>
180. Glorified be thy Lord, the Lord of Majesty, from that which they attribute<br>
[unto Him]<br>
181. And peace be unto those sent [to warn].<br>
182. And praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds!<br>
<br>
SURA 38. SAD (THE LETTER SAD)<br>
1. Sad. By the renowned Qur'an,<br>
2. Nay, but those who disbelieve are in false pride and schism.<br>
3. How many a generation We destroyed before them, and they cried out when it<br>
was no longer the time for escape!<br>
4. And they marvel that a warner from among themselves hath come unto them, and<br>
the disbelievers say: This is a wizard, a charlatan.<br>
5. Maketh he the gods One Allah? Lo! that is an astounding thing.<br>
6. The chiefs among them go about, exhorting: Go and be staunch to your gods!<br>
Lo! this is a thing designed.<br>
7. We have not heard of this in later religion. This is naught but an invention.<br>
8. Hath the reminder been unto him [alone] among us? Nay, but they are in doubt<br>
concerning My reminder; nay but they have not yet tasted My doom.<br>
9. Or are theirs the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the<br>
Bestower?<br>
<br>
216<br>
<br>
10. Or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them<br>
theirs? Then let them ascend by ropes!<br>
11. A defeated host are [all] the factions that are there.<br>
12. The folk of Noah before them denied [their messenger] and [so did the tribe<br>
of] A'ad, and Pharaoh firmly planted,<br>
13. And [the tribe of] Thamud, and the folk of Lot, and the dwellers in the<br>
wood: these were the factions.<br>
14. Not one of them but did deny the messengers, therefor My doom was justified,<br>
15. These wait for but one Shout, there will be no second thereto.<br>
16. They say: Our Lord! Hasten on for us our fate before the Day of Reckoning.<br>
17. Bear with what they say, and remember Our bondman David, lord of might, Lo!<br>
he was ever turning in repentance [toward Allah].<br>
18. Lo! We subdued the hills to hymn the praises [of their Lord] with him at<br>
nightfall and sunrise,<br>
19. And the birds assembled; all were turning unto Him.<br>
20. We made his kingdom strong and gave him wisdom and decisive speech.<br>
21. And hath the story of the litigants come unto thee? How they climbed the<br>
wall into the royal chamber;<br>
22. How they burst in upon David, and he was afraid of them. They said: Be not<br>
afraid! [We are] two litigants, one of whom hath wronged the other, therefor<br>
judge aright between us; be not unjust; and show us the fair way.<br>
23. Lo! this my brother hath ninety and nine ewes while I had one ewe; and he<br>
said: Entrust it to me, and he conquered me in speech.<br>
24. [David] said: He hath wronged thee in demanding thine ewe in addition to his<br>
ewes, and lo! many partners oppress one another, save such as believe and do<br>
good works, and they are few. And David guessed that We had tried him, and he<br>
sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and<br>
repented.<br>
25. So We forgave him that; and lo! he had access to Our presence and a happy<br>
journey's end.<br>
26. [And it was said unto him]: O David! Lo! We have set thee as a viceroy in<br>
the earth; therefor judge aright between mankind, and follow not desire that it<br>
beguile thee from the way of Allah. Lo! those who wander from the way of Allah<br>
have an awful doom, forasmuch as they forgot the Day of Reckoning.<br>
27. And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in<br>
vain. That is the opinion of those who disbelieve. And woe unto those who<br>
disbelieve, from the Fire!<br>
28. Shall We treat those who believe and do good works as those who spread<br>
corruption in the earth; or shall We treat the pious as the wicked?<br>
29. [This is] a Scripture that We have revealed unto thee, full of blessing,<br>
that they may ponder its revelations, and that men of understanding may reflect.<br>
30. And We bestowed on David, Solomon. How excellent a slave! Lo! he was ever<br>
turning in repentance [toward Allah].<br>
31. When there were shown to him at eventide lightfooted coursers<br>
<br>
217<br>
<br>
32. And he said: Lo! I have preferred the good things [of the world] to the<br>
remembrance of my Lord; till they were taken out of sight behind the curtain.<br>
33. [Then he said]: Bring them back to me, and fell to slashing [with his sword<br>
their] legs and necks.<br>
34. And verily We tried Solomon, and set upon his throne a [mere] body. Then did<br>
he repent.<br>
35. He said: My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me sovereignty such as shall not<br>
belong to any after me. Lo! Thou art the Bestower.<br>
36. So We made the wind subservient unto him, setting fair by his command<br>
whithersoever he intended.<br>
37. And the unruly, every builder and diver [made We subservient],<br>
38. And others linked together in chains,<br>
39. [Saying]: This is Our gift, so bestow thou, or withhold, without reckoning.<br>
40. And lo! he hath favour with Us, and a happy journey's end.<br>
41. And make mention [O Muhammad] of Our bondman Job, when he cried unto his<br>
Lord [saying]: Lo! the devil doth afflict me with distress and torment.<br>
42. [And it was said unto him]: Strike the ground with thy foot. This [spring]<br>
is a cool bath and a refreshing drink.<br>
43. And We bestowed on him [again] his household and therewith the like thereof,<br>
a mercy from Us, and a memorial for men of understanding.<br>
44. And [it was said unto him]: Take in thine hand a branch and smite therewith,<br>
and break not thine oath. Lo! We found him steadfast, how excellent a slave! Lo!<br>
he was ever turning in repentance [to his Lord].<br>
45. And make mention of Our bondmen, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, men of parts and<br>
vision.<br>
46. Lo! We purified them with a pure thought, remembrance of the Home [of the<br>
Hereafter].<br>
47. Lo! in Our sight they are verily of the elect, the excellent.<br>
48. And make mention of Ishmael and Elisha and Dhu'l-Kifl. All are of the<br>
chosen.<br>
49. This is a reminder. And lo! for those who ward off [evil] is a happy<br>
journey's end,<br>
50. Gardens of Eden, whereof the gates are opened for them,<br>
51. Wherein, reclining, they call for plenteous fruit and cool drink [that is]<br>
therein.<br>
52. And with them are those of modest gaze, companions.<br>
53. This it is that ye are promised for the Day of Reckoning.<br>
54. Lo! this in truth is Our provision, which will never waste away.<br>
55. This [is for the righteous]. And lo! for the transgressors there with be an<br>
evil journey's end,<br>
56. Hell, where they will burn, an evil resting-place.<br>
57. Here is a boiling and an ice-cold draught, so let them taste it,<br>
58. And other [torment] of the kind in pairs [the two extremes]!<br>
<br>
218<br>
<br>
59. Here is an army rushing blindly with you. [Those who are already in the Fire<br>
say]: No word of welcome for them. Lo! they will roast at the Fire.<br>
60. They say: Nay, but you [misleaders], for you there is no word of welcome. Ye<br>
prepared this for us [by your misleading]. Now hapless is the plight.<br>
61. They say: Our Lord! Whoever did prepare this for us, oh, give him double<br>
portion of the Fire!<br>
62. And they say: What aileth us that we behold not men whom we were wont to<br>
count among the wicked?<br>
63. Did we take them [wrongly] for a laughing-stock, or have our eyes missed<br>
them?<br>
64. Lo! that is very truth: the wrangling of the dwellers in the Fire.<br>
65. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: I am only a warner, and there is no Allah save<br>
Allah, the One, the Absolute,<br>
66. Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the Mighty,<br>
the Pardoning.<br>
67. Say: It is tremendous tidings<br>
68. Whence ye turn away!<br>
69. I had no knowledge of the Highest Chiefs when they disputed;<br>
70. It is revealed unto me only that I may be a plain warner.<br>
71. When thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am about to create a mortal out of<br>
mire,<br>
72. And when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My Spirit, then fall<br>
down before him prostrate,<br>
73. The angels fell down prostrate, every one,<br>
74. Saving Iblis; he was scornful and became one of the disbelievers.<br>
75. He said: O Iblis! What hindereth thee from falling prostrate before that<br>
which I have created with both My hands? Art thou too proud or art thou of the<br>
high exalted?<br>
76. He said: I am better than him. Thou createdst me of fire, whilst him Thou<br>
didst create of clay.<br>
77. He said: Go forth from hence, for lo! thou art outcast,<br>
78. And lo! My curse is on thee till the Day of Judgment.<br>
79. He said: My Lord! Reprieve me till the day when they are raised.<br>
80. He said: Lo! thou art of those reprieved<br>
81. Until the day of the time appointed.<br>
82. He said: Then, by Thy might, I surely will beguile them every one,<br>
83. Save Thy single-minded slaves among them.<br>
84. He said: The Truth is, and the Truth I speak,<br>
85. That I shall fill hell with thee and with such of them as follow thee,<br>
together.<br>
86. Say [O Muhammad, unto mankind]: I ask of you no fee for this, and I am no<br>
simulating.<br>
<br>
219<br>
<br>
87. Lo! it is naught else than a reminder for all peoples<br>
88. And ye will come in time to know the truth thereof.<br>
<br>
SURA 39. AZ-ZUMAR (THE TROOPS, THRONGS)<br>
1. The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
2. Lo! We have revealed the Scripture unto thee [Muhammad] with truth; so<br>
worship Allah, making religion pure for Him [only].<br>
3. Surely pure religion is for Allah only. And those who choose protecting<br>
friends beside Him [say]: We worship them only that they may bring us near unto<br>
Allah. Lo! Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ.<br>
Lo! Allah guideth not him who is a liar, an ingrate.<br>
4. If Allah had willed to choose a son, He could have chosen what He would of<br>
that which He hath created. Be He Glorified! He is Allah, the One, the Absolute.<br>
5. He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth. He maketh night to<br>
succeed day, and He maketh day to succeed night, and He constraineth the sun and<br>
the moon to give service, each running on for an appointed term. Is not He the<br>
Mighty, the Forgiver?<br>
6. He created you from one being, then from that [being] He made its mate; and<br>
He hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds. He created you in the wombs of<br>
your mothers, creation after creation, in a threefold gloom. Such is Allah, your<br>
Lord. His is the Sovereignty. There is no Allah save Him. How then are ye turned<br>
away?<br>
7. If ye are thankless, yet Allah is Independent of you, though He is not<br>
pleased with thanklessness for His bondmen; and if ye are thankful He is pleased<br>
therewith for you. No laden soul will bear another's load. Then unto your Lord<br>
is your return; and He will tell you what ye used to do. Lo! He knoweth what is<br>
in the breasts [of men].<br>
8. And when some hurt toucheth man, he crieth unto his Lord, turning unto Him<br>
[repentant]. Then, when He granteth him a boon from Him he forgetteth that for<br>
which he cried unto Him before, and setteth up rivals to Allah that he may<br>
beguile [men] from his way. Say [O Muhammad, unto such an one]: Take pleasure in<br>
thy disbelief a while. Lo! thou art of the owners of the Fire.<br>
9. Is he who payeth adoration in the watches of the night, prostrate and<br>
standing, bewaring of the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, [to be<br>
accounted equal with a disbeliever]? Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Are those who<br>
know equal with those who know not? But only men of understanding will pay heed.<br>
10. Say: O My bondmen who believe! Observe your duty to your Lord. For those who<br>
do good in this world there is good, and Allah's earth is spacious. Verily the<br>
steadfast will be paid their wages without stint.<br>
11. Say [O Muhammad]: Lo! I am commanded to worship Allah, making religion pure<br>
for Him [only].<br>
12. And I am commanded to be the first of those who are muslims [surrender unto<br>
Him].<br>
13. Say: Lo! if I should disobey my Lord, I fear the doom of a tremendous Day.<br>
14. Say: Allah I worship, making my religion pure for Him [only].<br>
<br>
220<br>
<br>
15. Then worship what ye will beside Him. Say: The losers will be those who lose<br>
themselves and their housefolk on the Day of Resurrection. Ah, that will be the<br>
manifest loss!<br>
16. They have an awning of fire above them and beneath them a dais [of fire].<br>
With this doth Allah appal His bondmen. O My bondmen, therefor fear Me!<br>
17. And those who put away false gods lest they should worship them and turn to<br>
Allah in repentance, for them there are glad tidings. Therefor give good tidings<br>
[O Muhammad] to My bondmen<br>
18. Who hear advice and follow the best thereof. Such are those whom Allah<br>
guideth, and such are men of understanding.<br>
19. Is he on whom the word of doom is fulfilled [to be helped], and canst thou<br>
[O Muhammad] rescue him who is in the Fire?<br>
20. But those who keep their duty to their Lord, for them are lofty halls with<br>
lofty halls above them, built [for them], beneath which rivers flow. [It is] a<br>
promise of Allah. Allah faileth not His promise.<br>
21. Hast thou not seen how Allah hath sent down water from the sky and hath<br>
caused it to penetrate the earth as watersprings, and afterward thereby<br>
produceth crops of divers hues; and afterward they wither and thou seest them<br>
turn yellow; then He maketh them chaff. Lo! herein verily is a reminder for men<br>
of understanding.<br>
22. Is he whose bosom Allah hath expanded for Al-Islam, so that he followeth a<br>
light from his Lord, [as he who disbelieveth]? Then woe unto those whose hearts<br>
are hardened against remembrance of Allah. Such are in plain error.<br>
23. Allah hath [now] revealed the fairest of statements, a Scripture consistent,<br>
[wherein promises of reward are] paired [with threats of punishment], whereat<br>
doth creep the flesh of those who fear their Lord, so that their flesh and their<br>
hearts soften to Allah's reminder. Such is Allah's guidance, wherewith He<br>
guideth whom He will. And him whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no<br>
guide.<br>
24. Is he then, who will strike his face against the awful doom upon the Day of<br>
Resurrection [as he who doeth right]? And it will be said unto the wrong-doers:<br>
Taste what ye used to earn.<br>
25. Those before them denied, and so the doom came on them whence they knew not.<br>
26. Thus Allah made them taste humiliation in the life of the world, and verily<br>
the doom of the Hereafter will be greater if they did but know.<br>
27. And verily We have coined for mankind in this Qur'an all kinds of<br>
similitudes, that haply they may reflect;<br>
28. A Lecture in Arabic, containing no crookedness, that haply they may ward off<br>
[evil].<br>
29. Allah coineth a similitude: A man in relation to whom are several partowners, quarrelling, and a man belonging wholly to one man. Are the two equal in<br>
similitude? Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not.<br>
30. Lo! thou wilt die, and lo! they will die;<br>
31. Then lo! on the Day of Resurrection, before your Lord ye will dispute.<br>
32. And who doth greater wrong than he who telleth a lie against Allah, and<br>
denieth the truth when it reacheth him? Will not the home of disbelievers be in<br>
hell?<br>
<br>
221<br>
<br>
33. And whoso bringeth the truth and believeth therein - Such are the dutiful.<br>
34. They shall have what they will of their Lord's bounty. That is the reward of<br>
the good:<br>
35. That Allah will remit from them the worst of what they did, and will pay<br>
them for reward the best they used to do.<br>
36. Will not Allah defend His slave? Yet they would frighten thee with those<br>
beside Him. He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no guide.<br>
37. And he whom Allah guideth, for him there can be no misleader. Is not Allah<br>
Mighty, Able to Requite [the wrong]?<br>
38. And verily, if thou shouldst ask them: Who created the heavens and the<br>
earth? they will say: Allah. Say: Bethink you then of those ye worship beside<br>
Allah, if Allah willed some hurt for me, could they remove from me His hurt; or<br>
if He willed some mercy for me, could they restrain His mercy? Say: Allah is my<br>
all. In Him do [all] the trusting put their trust.<br>
39. Say: O my people! Act in your manner. Lo! I [too] am acting. Thus ye will<br>
come to know<br>
40. Who it is unto whom cometh a doom that will abase him, and on whom there<br>
falleth everlasting doom.<br>
41. Lo! We have revealed unto thee [Muhammad] the Scripture for mankind with<br>
truth. Then whosoever goeth right it is for his soul, and whosoever strayeth,<br>
strayeth only to its hurt. And thou art not a warder over them.<br>
42. Allah receiveth [men's] souls at the time of their death, and that [soul]<br>
which dieth not [yet] in its sleep. He keepeth that [soul] for which He hath<br>
ordained death and dismisseth the rest till an appointed term. Lo! herein verily<br>
are portents for people who take thought.<br>
43. Or choose they intercessors other than Allah? Say: What! Even though they<br>
have power over nothing and have no intelligence?<br>
44. Say: Unto Allah belongeth all intercession. His is the Sovereignty of the<br>
heavens and the earth. And afterward unto Him ye will be brought back.<br>
45. And when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in<br>
the Hereafter are repelled, and when those [whom they worship] beside Him are<br>
mentioned, behold! they are glad.<br>
46. Say: O Allah! Creator of the heavens and the earth! Knower of the Invisible<br>
and the Visible! Thou wilt judge between Thy slaves concerning that wherein they<br>
used to differ.<br>
47. And though those who do wrong possess all that is in the earth, and<br>
therewith as much again, they verily will seek to ransom themselves therewith on<br>
the Day of Resurrection from the awful doom; and there will appear unto them,<br>
from their Lord, that wherewith they never reckoned.<br>
48. And the evils that they earned will appear unto them, and that whereat they<br>
used to scoff will surround them.<br>
49. Now when hurt toucheth a man he crieth unto Us, and afterward when We have<br>
granted him a boon from Us, he saith: Only by force of knowledge I obtained it.<br>
Nay, but it is a test. But most of them know not.<br>
50. Those before them said it, yet [all] that they had earned availed them not;<br>
51. But the evils that they earned smote them; and such of these as do wrong,<br>
the evils that they earn will smite them; they cannot escape.<br>
<br>
222<br>
<br>
52. Know they not that Allah enlargeth providence for whom He will, and<br>
straiteneth it [for whom He will]. Lo! herein verily are portents for people who<br>
believe.<br>
53. Say: O My slaves who have been prodigal to their own hurt! Despair not of<br>
the mercy of Allah, Who forgiveth all sins. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the<br>
Merciful.<br>
54. Turn unto your Lord repentant, and surrender unto Him, before there come<br>
unto you the doom, when ye cannot be helped.<br>
55. And follow the better [guidance] of that which is revealed unto you from<br>
your Lord, before the doom cometh on you suddenly when ye know not,<br>
56. Lest any soul should say: Alas, my grief that I was unmindful of Allah, and<br>
I was indeed among the scoffers!<br>
57. Or should say: If Allah had but guided me I should have been among the<br>
dutiful!<br>
58. Or should say, when it seeth the doom: Oh, that I had but a second chance<br>
that I might be among the righteous!<br>
59. [But now the answer will be]: Nay, for My revelations came unto thee, but<br>
thou didst deny them and wast scornful and wast among the disbelievers.<br>
60. And on the Day of Resurrection thou [Muhammad] seest those who lied<br>
concerning Allah with their faces blackened. Is not the home of the scorners in<br>
hell?<br>
61. And Allah delivereth those who ward off [evil] because of their deserts.<br>
Evil toucheth them not, nor do they grieve.<br>
62. Allah is Creator of all things, and He is Guardian over all things.<br>
63. His are the keys of the heavens and the earth, and they who disbelieve the<br>
revelations of Allah - such are they who are the losers.<br>
64. Say [O Muhammad, to the disbelievers]: Do ye bid me serve other than Allah?<br>
O ye fools!<br>
65. And verily it hath been revealed unto thee as unto those before thee<br>
[saying]: If thou ascribe a partner to Allah thy work will fail and thou indeed<br>
wilt be among the losers.<br>
66. Nay, but Allah must thou serve, and be among the thankful!<br>
67. And they esteem not Allah as He hath the right to be esteemed, when the<br>
whole earth is His handful on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens are<br>
rolled in His right hand. Glorified is He and High Exalted from all that they<br>
ascribe as partner [unto Him].<br>
68. And the trumpet is blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are in<br>
the earth swoon away, save him whom Allah willeth. Then it is blown a second<br>
time, and behold them standing waiting!<br>
69. And the earth shineth with the light of her Lord, and the Book is set up,<br>
and the prophets and the witnesses are brought, and it is judged between them<br>
with truth, and they are not wronged.<br>
70. And each soul is paid in full for what it did. And He is Best Aware of what<br>
they do.<br>
71. And those who disbelieve are driven unto hell in troops till, when they<br>
reach it and the gates thereof are opened, and the warders thereof say unto<br>
them: Came there not unto you messengers of your own, reciting unto you the<br>
223<br>
<br>
revelations of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this your Day? they<br>
say: Yea, verily. But the word of doom of disbelievers is fulfilled.<br>
72. It is said [unto them]: Enter ye the gates of hell to dwell therein. Thus<br>
hapless is the journey's end of the scorners.<br>
73. And those who keep their duty to their Lord are driven unto the Garden in<br>
troops till, when they reach it, and the gates thereof are opened, and the<br>
warders thereof say unto them: Peace be unto you! Ye are good, so enter ye [the<br>
Garden of delight], to dwell therein;<br>
74. They say: Praise be to Allah, Who hath fulfilled His promise unto us and<br>
hath made us inherit the land, sojourning in the Garden where we will! So<br>
bounteous is the wage of workers.<br>
75. And thou [O Muhammad] seest the angels thronging round the Throne, hymning<br>
the praises of their Lord. And they are judged aright. And it is said: Praise be<br>
to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!<br>
<br>
SURA 40. AL-GHAFIR (THE FORGIVER (GOD) )<br>
1. Ha. Mim.<br>
2. The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah, the Mighty, the Knower,<br>
3. The Forgiver of sin, the Accepter of repentance, the Stern in punishment, the<br>
Bountiful. There is no Allah save Him. Unto Him is the journeying.<br>
4. None argue concerning the revelations of Allah save those who disbelieve, so<br>
let not their turn of fortune in the land deceive thee [O Muhammad].<br>
5. The folk of Noah and the factions after them denied [their messengers] before<br>
these, and every nation purposed to seize their messenger and argued falsely,<br>
[thinking] thereby to refute the Truth. Then I seized them, and how [awful] was<br>
My punishment.<br>
6. Thus was the word of thy Lord concerning those who disbelieve fulfilled: That<br>
they are owners of the Fire.<br>
7. Those who bear the Throne, and all who are round about it, hymn the praises<br>
of their Lord and believe in Him and ask forgiveness for those who believe<br>
[saying]: Our Lord! Thou comprehendest all things in mercy and knowledge,<br>
therefor forgive those who repent and follow Thy way. Ward off from them the<br>
punishment of hell.<br>
8. Our Lord! And make them enter the Gardens of Eden which thou hast promised<br>
them, with such of their fathers and their wives and their descendants as do<br>
right. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
9. And ward off from them ill-deeds; and he from whom Thou wardest off ill-deeds<br>
that day, him verily hast Thou taken into mercy. That is the supreme triumph.<br>
10. Lo! [on that day] those who disbelieve are informed by proclamation: Verily<br>
Allah's abhorrence is more terrible than your abhorrence one of another, when ye<br>
were called unto the faith but did refuse.<br>
11. They say: Our Lord! Twice hast Thou made us die, and twice hast Thou made us<br>
live. Now we confess our sins. Is there any way to go out?<br>
12. [It is said unto them]: This is [your plight] because, when Allah only was<br>
invoked, ye disbelieved, but when some partner was ascribed to Him ye were<br>
believing. But the command belongeth only to Allah, the Sublime, the Majestic.<br>
<br>
224<br>
<br>
13. He it is Who showeth you His portents, and sendeth down for you provision<br>
from the sky. None payeth heed save him who turneth [unto Him] repentant.<br>
14. Therefor [O believers] pray unto Allah, making religion pure for Him [only],<br>
however much the disbelievers be averse 15. The Exalter of Ranks, the Lord of the Throne. He causeth the Spirit of His<br>
command upon whom He will of His slaves, that He may warn of the Day of Meeting,<br>
16. The day when they come forth, nothing of them being hidden from Allah. Whose<br>
is the Sovereignty this day? It is Allah's, the One, the Almighty.<br>
17. This day is each soul requited that which it hath earned; no wrong [is done]<br>
this day. Lo! Allah is swift at reckoning.<br>
18. Warn them [O Muhammad] of the Day of the approaching [doom], when the hearts<br>
will be choking the throats, [when] there will be no friend for the wrong-doers,<br>
nor any intercessor who will be heard.<br>
19. He knoweth the traitor of the eyes, and that which the bosoms hide.<br>
20. Allah judgeth with truth, while those to whom they cry instead of Him judge<br>
not at all. Lo! Allah, He is the Hearer, the Seer.<br>
21. Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for<br>
those who disbelieved before them? They were mightier than these in power and<br>
[in the] traces [which they left behind them] in the earth. Yet Allah seized<br>
them for their sins, and they had no protector from Allah.<br>
22. That was because their messengers kept bringing them clear proofs [of<br>
Allah's Sovereignty] but they disbelieved; so Allah seized them. Lo! He is<br>
Strong, severe in punishment.<br>
23. And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations and a clear warrant<br>
24. Unto Pharaoh and Haman and Korah, but they said: A lying sorcerer!<br>
25. And when he brought them the Truth from Our presence, they said: Slay the<br>
sons of those who believe with him, and spare their women. But the plot of<br>
disbelievers is in naught but error.<br>
26. And Pharaoh said: Suffer me to kill Moses, and let him cry unto his Lord.<br>
Lo! I fear that he will alter your religion or that he will cause confusion in<br>
the land.<br>
27. Moses said: Lo! I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every scorner<br>
who believeth not in a Day of Reckoning.<br>
28. And a believing man of Pharaoh's family, who hid his faith, said: Would ye<br>
kill a man because he saith: My Lord is Allah, and hath brought you clear proofs<br>
from your Lord? If he is lying, then his lie is upon him; and if he is truthful,<br>
then some of that wherewith he threateneth you will strike you. Lo! Allah<br>
guideth not one who is a prodigal, a liar.<br>
29. O my people! Yours is the kingdom to-day, ye being uppermost in the land.<br>
But who would save us from the wrath of Allah should it reach us? Pharaoh said:<br>
I do but show you what I think, and I do but guide you to wise policy.<br>
30. And he who believed said: O my people! Lo! I fear for you a fate like that<br>
of the factions [of old];<br>
31. A plight like that of Noah's folk, and A'ad and Thamud, and those after<br>
them, and Allah willeth no injustice for [His] slaves.<br>
32. And, O my people! Lo! I fear for you a Day of Summoning,<br>
<br>
225<br>
<br>
33. A day when ye will turn to flee, having no preserver from Allah: and he whom<br>
Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no guide.<br>
34. And verily Joseph brought you of old clear proofs, yet ye ceased not to be<br>
in doubt concerning what he brought you till, when he died, ye said: Allah will<br>
not send any messenger after him. Thus Allah deceiveth him who is a prodigal, a<br>
doubter.<br>
35. Those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah without any warrant<br>
that hath come unto them, it is greatly hateful in the sight of Allah and in the<br>
sight of those who believe. Thus doth Allah print on every arrogant, disdainful<br>
heart.<br>
36. And Pharaoh said: O Haman! Build for me a tower that haply I may reach the<br>
roads,<br>
37. The roads of the heavens, and may look upon the god of Moses, though verily<br>
I think him a liar. Thus was the evil that he did made fairseeming unto Pharaoh,<br>
and he was debarred from the [right] way. The plot of Pharaoh ended but in ruin.<br>
38. And he who believed said: O my people! Follow me. I will show you the way of<br>
right conduct.<br>
39. O my people! Lo! this life of the world is but a passing comfort, and lo!<br>
the Hereafter, that is the enduring home.<br>
40. Whoso doeth an ill-deed, he will be repaid the like thereof, while whoso<br>
doeth right, whether male or female, and is a believer, [all] such will enter<br>
the Garden, where they will be nourished without stint.<br>
41. And, O my people! What aileth me that I call you unto deliverance when ye<br>
call me unto the Fire?<br>
42. Ye call me to disbelieve in Allah and ascribe unto Him as partners that<br>
whereof I have no knowledge, while I call you unto the Mighty, the Forgiver.<br>
43. Assuredly that whereunto ye call me hath no claim in the world or in the<br>
Hereafter, and our return will be unto Allah, and the prodigals will be owners<br>
of the Fire.<br>
44. And ye will remember what I say unto you. I confide my cause unto Allah. Lo!<br>
Allah is Seer of [His] slaves.<br>
45. So Allah warded off from him the evils which they plotted, while a dreadful<br>
doom encompassed Pharaoh's folk,<br>
46. The Fire; they are exposed to it morning and evening; and on the day when<br>
the Hour upriseth [it is said]: Cause Pharaoh's folk to enter the most awful<br>
doom.<br>
47. And when they wrangle in the Fire, the weak say unto those who were proud:<br>
Lo! we were a following unto you; will ye therefor rid us of a portion of the<br>
Fire?<br>
48. Those who were proud say: Lo! we are all [together] herein. Lo! Allah hath<br>
judged between [His] slaves.<br>
49. And those in the Fire say unto the guards of hell: Entreat your Lord that He<br>
relieve us of a day of the torment.<br>
50. They say: Came not your messengers unto you with clear proofs? They say:<br>
Yea, verily. They say: Then do ye pray, although the prayer of disbelievers is<br>
in vain.<br>
<br>
226<br>
<br>
51. Lo! We verily do help Our messengers, and those who believe, in the life of<br>
the world and on the day when the witnesses arise,<br>
52. The day when their excuse availeth not the evil-doers, and theirs is the<br>
curse, and theirs the ill abode.<br>
53. And We verily gave Moses the guidance, and We caused the Children of Israel<br>
to inherit the Scripture,<br>
54. A guide and a reminder for men of understanding.<br>
55. Then have patience [O Muhammad]. Lo! the promise of Allah is true. And ask<br>
forgiveness of thy sin, and hymn the praise of thy Lord at fall of night and in<br>
the early hours.<br>
56. Lo! those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah without a warrant<br>
having come unto them, there is naught else in their breasts save pride which<br>
they will never attain. So take thou refuge in Allah. Lo! He, only He, is the<br>
Hearer, the Seer.<br>
57. Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the<br>
creation of mankind; but most of mankind know not.<br>
58. And the blind man and the seer are not equal, neither are those who believe<br>
and do good works [equal with] the evil-doer. Little do ye reflect!<br>
59. Lo! the Hour is surely coming, there is no doubt thereof; yet most of<br>
mankind believe not.<br>
60. And your Lord hath said: Pray unto Me and I will hear your prayer. Lo! those<br>
who scorn My service, they will enter hell, disgraced.<br>
61. Allah it is Who hath appointed for you night that ye may rest therein, and<br>
day for seeing. Lo! Allah is a Lord of bounty for mankind, yet most of mankind<br>
give not thanks.<br>
62. Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, There is no Allah save<br>
Him. How then are ye perverted?<br>
63. Thus are they perverted who deny the revelations of Allah.<br>
64. Allah it is Who appointed for you the earth for a dwelling-place and the sky<br>
for a canopy, and fashioned you and perfected your shapes, and hath provided you<br>
with good things. Such is Allah, your Lord. Then blessed be Allah, the Lord of<br>
the Worlds!<br>
65. He is the Living One. There is no Allah save Him. So pray unto Him, making<br>
religion pure for Him [only]. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!<br>
66. Say [O Muhammad]: I am forbidden to worship those unto whom ye cry beside<br>
Allah since there have come unto me clear proofs from my Lord, and I am<br>
commanded to surrender to the Lord of the Worlds.<br>
67. He it is Who created you from dust, then from a drop [of seed] then from a<br>
clot, then bringeth you forth as a child, then [ordaineth] that ye attain full<br>
strength and afterward that ye become old men - though some among you die before<br>
- and that ye reach an appointed term, that haply ye may understand.<br>
68. He it is Who quickeneth and giveth death. When He ordaineth a thing, He<br>
saith unto it only: Be! and it is.<br>
69. Hast thou not seen those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah,<br>
how they are turned away? 70. Those who deny the Scripture and that wherewith We send Our messengers. But<br>
they will come to know,<br>
227<br>
<br>
71. When carcans are about their necks and chains. They are dragged<br>
72. Through boiling waters; then they are thrust into the Fire.<br>
73. Then it is said unto them: Where are [all] that ye used to make partners [in<br>
the Sovereignty]<br>
74. Beside Allah? They say: They have failed us; but we used not to pray to<br>
anything before. Thus doth Allah send astray the disbelievers [in His guidance].<br>
75. [And it is said unto them]: This is because ye exulted in the earth without<br>
right, and because ye were petulant.<br>
76. Enter ye the gates of hell, to dwell therein. Evil is the habitation of the<br>
scornful.<br>
77. Then have patience [O Muhammad]. Lo! the promise of Allah is true. And<br>
whether we let thee see a part of that which We promise them, or [whether] We<br>
cause thee to die, still unto Us they will be brought back.<br>
78. Verily We sent messengers before thee, among them those of whom We have told<br>
thee, and some of whom We have not told thee; and it was not given to any<br>
messenger that he should bring a portent save by Allah's leave, but when Allah's<br>
commandment cometh [the cause] is judged aright, and the followers of vanity<br>
will then be lost.<br>
79. Allah it is Who hath appointed for you cattle, that ye may ride on some of<br>
them, and eat of some 80. [Many] benefits ye have from them - and that ye may satisfy by their means a<br>
need that is in your breasts, and may be borne upon them as upon the ship.<br>
81. And He showeth you His tokens. Which, then, of the tokens of Allah do ye<br>
deny?<br>
82. Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for<br>
those before them? They were more numerous than these, and mightier in power and<br>
[in the] traces [which they left behind them] in the earth. But all that they<br>
used to earn availed them not.<br>
83. And when their messengers brought them clear proofs [of Allah's Sovereignty]<br>
they exulted in the knowledge they [themselves] possessed. And that which they<br>
were wont to mock befell them.<br>
84. Then, when they saw Our doom, they said: We believe in Allah only and reject<br>
[all] that we used to associate [with Him].<br>
85. But their faith could not avail them when they saw Our doom. This is Allah's<br>
law which hath ever taken course for His bondmen. And then the disbelievers will<br>
be ruined.<br>
<br>
SURA 41. FUSSILAT (EXPLAINED IN DETAIL)<br>
1. Ha. Mim.<br>
2. A revelation from the Beneficent, the Merciful,<br>
3. A Scripture whereof the verses are expounded, a Lecture in Arabic for people<br>
who have knowledge,<br>
4. Good tidings and a warning. But most of them turn away so that they hear not.<br>
<br>
228<br>
<br>
5. And they say: Our hearts are protected from that unto which thou [O Muhammad]<br>
callest us, and in our ears there is a deafness, and between us and thee there<br>
is a veil. Act, then. Lo! we also shall be acting.<br>
6. Say [unto them O Muhammad]: I am only a mortal like you. It is inspired in me<br>
that your Allah is One Allah, therefor take the straight path unto Him and seek<br>
forgiveness of Him. And woe unto the idolaters,<br>
7. Who give not the poor-due, and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter.<br>
8. Lo! as for those who believe and do good works, for them is a reward<br>
enduring.<br>
9. Say [O Muhammad, unto the idolaters]: Disbelieve ye verily in Him Who created<br>
the earth in two Days, and ascribe ye unto Him rivals? He [and none else] is the<br>
Lord of the Worlds.<br>
10. He placed therein firm hills rising above it, and blessed it and measured<br>
therein its sustenance in four Days, alike for [all] who ask;<br>
11. Then turned He to the heaven when it was smoke, and said unto it and unto<br>
the earth: Come both of you, willingly or loth. They said: We come, obedient.<br>
12. Then He ordained them seven heavens in two Days and inspired in each heaven<br>
its mandate; and We decked the nether heaven with lamps, and rendered it<br>
inviolable. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Knower.<br>
13. But if they turn away, then say: I warn you of a thunderbolt like the<br>
thunderbolt [which fell of old upon the tribes] of A'ad and Thamud;<br>
14. When their messengers came unto them from before them and behind them,<br>
saying: Worship none but Allah! they said: If our Lord had willed, He surely<br>
would have sent down angels [unto us], so lo! we are disbelievers in that<br>
wherewith ye have been sent.<br>
15. As for A'ad, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said:<br>
Who is mightier than us in power? Could they not see that Allah Who created<br>
them, He was mightier than them in power? And they denied Our revelations.<br>
16. Therefor We let loose on them a raging wind in evil days, that We might make<br>
them taste the torment of disgrace in the life of the world. And verily the doom<br>
of the Hereafter will be more shameful, and they will not be helped.<br>
17. And as for Thamud, We gave them guidance, but they preferred blindness to<br>
the guidance, so the bolt of the doom of humiliation overtook them because of<br>
what they used to earn.<br>
18. And We delivered those who believed and used to keep their duty to Allah.<br>
19. And [make mention of] the day when the enemies of Allah are gathered unto<br>
the Fire, they are driven on<br>
20. Till, when they reach it, their ears and their eyes and their skins testify<br>
against them as to what they used to do.<br>
21. And they say unto their skins: Why testify ye against us? They say: Allah<br>
hath given us speech Who giveth speech to all things, and Who created you at the<br>
first, and unto Whom ye are returned.<br>
22. Ye did not hide yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins<br>
should testify against you, but ye deemed that Allah knew not much of what ye<br>
did.<br>
23. That, your thought which ye did think about your Lord, hath ruined you; and<br>
ye find yourselves [this day] among the lost.<br>
<br>
229<br>
<br>
24. And though they are resigned, yet the Fire is still their home; and if they<br>
ask for favour, yet they are not of those unto whom favour can be shown.<br>
25. And We assigned them comrades [in the world], who made their present and<br>
their past fairseeming unto them. And the Word concerning nations of the jinn<br>
and humankind who passed away before them hath effect for them. Lo! they were<br>
ever losers.<br>
26. Those who disbelieve say: Heed not this Qur'an, and drown the hearing of it;<br>
haply ye may conquer.<br>
27. But verily We shall cause those who disbelieve to taste an awful doom, and<br>
verily We shall requite them the worst of what they used to do.<br>
28. That is the reward of Allah's enemies: the Fire. Therein is their immortal<br>
home, payment forasmuch as they denied Our revelations.<br>
29. And those who disbelieve will say: Our Lord! Show us those who beguiled us<br>
of the jinn and humankind. We will place them underneath our feet that they may<br>
be among the nethermost.<br>
30. Lo! those who say: Our Lord is Allah, and afterward are upright, the angels<br>
descend upon them, saying: Fear not nor grieve, but hear good tidings of the<br>
paradise which ye are promised.<br>
31. We are your protecting friends in the life of the world and in the<br>
Hereafter. There ye will have [all] that your souls desire, and there ye will<br>
have [all] for which ye pray.<br>
32. A gift of welcome from One Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
33. And who is better in speech than him who prayeth unto his Lord and doeth<br>
right, and saith: Lo! I am of those who are muslims [surrender unto Him].<br>
34. The good deed and the evil deed are not alike. Repel the evil deed with one<br>
which is better, then lo! he, between whom and thee there was enmity [will<br>
become] as though he was a bosom friend.<br>
35. But none is granted it save those who are steadfast, and none is granted it<br>
save the owner of great happiness.<br>
36. And if a whisper from the devil reach thee [O Muhammad] then seek refuge in<br>
Allah. Lo! He is the Hearer, the Knower.<br>
37. And of His portents are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do<br>
not prostrate to the sun or the moon; but prostrate to Allah Who created them,<br>
if it is in truth Him Whom ye worship.<br>
38. But if they are too proud - still those who are with thy Lord glorify Him<br>
night and day, and tire not.<br>
39. And of His portents [is this]: that thou seest the earth lowly, but when We<br>
send down water thereon it thrilleth and groweth. Lo! He Who quickeneth it is<br>
verily the Quickener of the Dead. Lo! He is Able to do all things.<br>
40. Lo! those who distort Our revelations are not hid from Us. Is he who is<br>
hurled into the Fire better, or he who cometh secure on the Day of Resurrection?<br>
Do what ye will. Lo! He is Seer of what ye do.<br>
41. Lo! those who disbelieve in the Reminder when it cometh unto them [are<br>
guilty], for lo! it is an unassailable Scripture.<br>
42. Falsehood cannot come at it from before it or from behind it. [It is] a<br>
revelation from the Wise, the Owner of Praise.<br>
<br>
230<br>
<br>
43. Naught is said unto thee [Muhammad] save what was said unto the messengers<br>
before thee. Lo! thy Lord is owner of forgiveness, and owner [also] of dire<br>
punishment.<br>
44. And if We had appointed it a Lecture in a foreign tongue they would<br>
assuredly have said: If only its verses were expounded [so that we might<br>
understand]? What! A foreign tongue and an Arab? - Say unto them [O Muhammad]:<br>
For those who believe it is a guidance and a healing; and as for those who<br>
disbelieve, there is a deafness in their ears, and it is blindness for them.<br>
Such are called to from afar.<br>
45. And We verily gave Moses the Scripture, but there hath been dispute<br>
concerning it; and but for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord, it<br>
would ere now have been judged between them; but lo! they are in hopeless doubt<br>
concerning it.<br>
46. Whoso doeth right it is for his soul, and whoso doeth wrong it is against<br>
it. And thy Lord is not at all a tyrant to His slaves.<br>
47. Unto Him is referred [all] knowledge of the Hour. And no fruits burst forth<br>
from their sheaths, and no female carrieth or bringeth forth but with His<br>
knowledge. And on the day when He calleth unto them: Where are now My partners?<br>
they will say: We confess unto Thee, not one of us is a witness [for them].<br>
48. And those to whom they used to cry of old have failed them, and they<br>
perceive they have no place of refuge.<br>
49. Man tireth not of praying for good, and if ill toucheth him, then he is<br>
disheartened, desperate.<br>
50. And verily, if We cause him to taste mercy after some hurt that hath touched<br>
him, he will say: This is my own; and I deem not that the Hour will ever rise,<br>
and if I am brought back to my Lord, I surely shall be better off with Him - But<br>
We verily shall tell those who disbelieve [all] that they did, and We verily<br>
shall make them taste hard punishment.<br>
51. When We show favour unto man, he withdraweth and turneth aside, but when ill<br>
toucheth him then he aboundeth in prayer.<br>
52. Bethink you: If it is from Allah and ye reject it - Who is further astray<br>
than one who is at open feud [with Allah]?<br>
53. We shall show them Our portents on the horizons and within themselves until<br>
it will be manifest unto them that it is the Truth. Doth not thy Lord suffice,<br>
since He is Witness over all things?<br>
54. How! Are they still in doubt about the meeting with their Lord? Lo! Is not<br>
He surrounding all things?<br>
<br>
SURA 42. ASH-SHURA (COUNCIL, CONSULTATION)<br>
1. Ha. Mim.<br>
2. A'in. Sin. Qaf.<br>
3. Thus Allah the Mighty, the Knower inspireth thee [Muhammad] as [He inspired]<br>
those before thee.<br>
4. Unto Him belongeth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth,<br>
and He is the Sublime, the Tremendous.<br>
<br>
231<br>
<br>
5. Almost might the heavens above be rent asunder while the angels hymn the<br>
praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on the earth. Lo! Allah, He<br>
is the Forgiver, the Merciful.<br>
6. And as for those who choose protecting friends beside Him, Allah is Warden<br>
over them, and thou art in no wise a guardian over them.<br>
7. And thus We have inspired in thee a Lecture in Arabic, that thou mayst warn<br>
the mother-town and those around it, and mayst warn of a day of assembling<br>
whereof there is no doubt. A host will be in the Garden, and a host of them in<br>
the Flame.<br>
8. Had Allah willed, He could have made them one community, but Allah bringeth<br>
whom He will into His mercy. And the wrong-doers have no friend nor helper.<br>
9. Or have they chosen protecting friends besides Him? But Allah, He [alone] is<br>
the Protecting Friend. He quickeneth the dead, and He is Able to do all things.<br>
10. And in whatsoever ye differ, the verdict therein belongeth to Allah. Such is<br>
my Lord, in Whom I put my trust, and unto Whom I turn.<br>
11. The Creator of the heavens and the earth. He hath made for you pairs of<br>
yourselves, and of the cattle also pairs, whereby He multiplieth you. Naught is<br>
as His likeness; and He is the Hearer, the Seer.<br>
12. His are the keys of the heavens and the earth. He enlargeth providence for<br>
whom He will and straiteneth [it for whom He will]. Lo! He is Knower of all<br>
things.<br>
13. He hath ordained for you that religion which He commended unto Noah, and<br>
that which We inspire in thee [Muhammad], and that which We commended unto<br>
Abraham and Moses and Jesus, saying: Establish the religion, and be not divided<br>
therein. Dreadful for the idolaters is that unto which thou callest them. Allah<br>
chooseth for Himself whom He will, and guideth unto Himself him who turneth<br>
[toward Him].<br>
14. And they were not divided until after the knowledge came unto them, through<br>
rivalry among themselves; and had it not been for a Word that had already gone<br>
forth from thy Lord for an appointed term, it surely had been judged between<br>
them. And those who were made to inherit the Scripture after them are verily in<br>
hopeless doubt concerning it.<br>
15. Unto this, then, summon [O Muhammad]. And be thou upright as thou art<br>
commanded, and follow not their lusts, but say: I believe in whatever scripture<br>
Allah hath sent down, and I am commanded to be just among you. Allah is our Lord<br>
and your Lord. Unto us our works and unto you your works; no argument between us<br>
and you. Allah will bring us together, and unto Him is the journeying.<br>
16. And those who argue concerning Allah after He hath been acknowledged, their<br>
argument hath no weight with their Lord, and wrath is upon them and theirs will<br>
be an awful doom.<br>
17. Allah it is Who hath revealed the Scripture with truth, and the Balance. How<br>
canst thou know? It may be that the Hour is nigh.<br>
18. Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it, while those who believe are<br>
fearful of it and know that it is the Truth. Are not they who dispute, in doubt<br>
concerning the Hour, far astray?<br>
19. Allah is gracious unto His slaves. He provideth for whom He will. And He is<br>
the Strong, the Mighty.<br>
<br>
232<br>
<br>
20. Whoso desireth the harvest of the Hereafter, We give him increase in its<br>
harvest. And whoso desireth the harvest of the world, We give him thereof, and<br>
he hath no portion in the Hereafter.<br>
21. Or have they partners [of Allah] who have made lawful for them in religion<br>
that which Allah allowed not? And but for a decisive word [gone forth already],<br>
it would have been judged between them. Lo! for wrong-doers is a painful doom.<br>
22. Thou seest the wrong-doers fearful of that which they have earned, and it<br>
will surely befall them, while those who believe and do good works [will be] in<br>
flowering meadows of the Gardens, having what they wish from their Lord. This is<br>
the great preferment.<br>
23. This it is which Allah announceth unto His bondmen who believe and do good<br>
works. Say [O Muhammad, unto mankind]: I ask of you no fee therefor, save<br>
lovingkindness among kinsfolk. And whoso scoreth a good deed We add unto its<br>
good for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Responsive.<br>
24. Or say they: He hath invented a lie concerning Allah? If Allah willed, He<br>
could have sealed thy heart [against them]. And Allah will wipe out the lie and<br>
will vindicate the truth by His words. Lo! He is Aware of what is hidden in the<br>
breasts [of men].<br>
25. And He it is Who accepteth repentance from His bondmen, and pardoneth the<br>
evil deeds, and knoweth what ye do,<br>
26. And accepteth those who do good works, and giveth increase unto them of His<br>
bounty. And as for disbelievers, theirs will be an awful doom.<br>
27. And if Allah were to enlarge the provision for His slaves they would surely<br>
rebel in the earth, but He sendeth down by measure as He willeth. Lo! He is<br>
Informed, a Seer of His bondmen.<br>
28. And He it is Who sendeth down the saving rain after they have despaired, and<br>
spreadeth out His mercy. He is the Protecting Friend, the Praiseworthy.<br>
29. And of His portents is the creation of the heaven and the earth, and of<br>
whatever beasts He hath dispersed therein. And He is Able to gather them when He<br>
will.<br>
30. Whatever of misfortune striketh you, it is what your right hands have<br>
earned. And He forgiveth much.<br>
31. Ye cannot escape in the earth, for beside Allah ye have no protecting friend<br>
nor any helper.<br>
32. And of His portents are the ships, like banners on the sea;<br>
33. If He will He calmeth the wind so that they keep still upon its surface Lo! herein verily are signs for every steadfast grateful [heart]. 34. Or He causeth them to perish on account of that which they have earned - And<br>
He forgiveth much 35. And that those who argue concerning Our revelations may know they have no<br>
refuge.<br>
36. Now whatever ye have been given is but a passing comfort for the life of the<br>
world, and that which Allah hath is better and more lasting for those who<br>
believe and put their trust in their Lord,<br>
37. And those who shun the worst of sins and indecencies and, when they are<br>
wroth, forgive,<br>
<br>
233<br>
<br>
38. And those who answer the call of their Lord and establish worship, and whose<br>
affairs are a matter of counsel, and who spend of what We have bestowed on them,<br>
39. And those who, when great wrong is done to them, defend themselves,<br>
40. The guerdon of an ill-deed is an ill the like thereof. But whosoever<br>
pardoneth and amendeth, his wage is the affair of Allah. Lo! He loveth not<br>
wrong-doers.<br>
41. And whoso defendeth himself after he hath suffered wrong - for such, there<br>
is no way [of blame] against them.<br>
42. The way [of blame] is only against those who oppress mankind, and wrongfully<br>
rebel in the earth. For such there is a painful doom.<br>
43. And verily whoso is patient and forgiveth - lo! that, verily, is [of] the<br>
steadfast heart of things.<br>
44. He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no protecting friend after<br>
Him. And thou [Muhammad] wilt see the evil-doers when they see the doom, [how]<br>
they say: Is there any way of return?<br>
45. And thou wilt see them exposed to [the Fire], made humble by disgrace, and<br>
looking with veiled eyes. And those who believe will say: Lo! the [eternal]<br>
losers are they who lose themselves and their housefolk on the Day of<br>
Resurrection. Lo! are not the wrong-doers in perpetual torment?<br>
46. And they will have no protecting friends to help them instead of Allah. He<br>
whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no road.<br>
47. Answer the call of your Lord before there cometh unto you from Allah a Day<br>
which there is no averting. Ye have no refuge on that Day, nor have a ye any<br>
[power of] refusal.<br>
48. But if they are averse, We have not sent thee as a warder over them. Thine<br>
is only to convey [the message]. And lo! when We cause man to taste of mercy<br>
from Us he exulteth therefor. And if some evil striketh them because of that<br>
which their own hands have sent before, then lo! man is an ingrate.<br>
49. Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He<br>
createth what He will. He bestoweth female [offspring] upon whom He will, and<br>
bestoweth male [offspring] upon whom He will;<br>
50. Or He mingleth them, males and females, and He maketh barren whom He will.<br>
Lo! He is Knower, Powerful.<br>
51. And it was not [vouchsafed] to any mortal that Allah should speak to him<br>
unless [it be] by revelation or from behind a veil, or [that] He sendeth a<br>
messenger to reveal what He will by His leave. Lo! He is Exalted, Wise.<br>
52. And thus have We inspired in thee [Muhammad] a Spirit of Our command. Thou<br>
knewest not what the Scripture was, nor what the Faith. But We have made it a<br>
light whereby We guide whom We will of Our bondmen. And lo! thou verily dost<br>
guide unto a right path,<br>
53. The path of Allah, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and<br>
whatsoever is in the earth. Do not all things reach Allah at last?<br>
<br>
SURA 43. AZ-ZUKHRUF (ORNAMENTS OF GOLD, LUXURY)<br>
1. Ha. Mim.<br>
2. By the Scripture which maketh plain,<br>
<br>
234<br>
<br>
3. Lo! We have appointed it a Lecture, in Arabic that haply ye may understand.<br>
4. And Lo! in the Source of Decrees, which We possess, it is indeed sublime,<br>
decisive.<br>
5. Shall We utterly ignore you because ye are a wanton folk?<br>
6. How many a prophet did We send among the men of old!<br>
7. And never came there unto them a prophet but they used to mock him.<br>
8. Then We destroyed men mightier than these in prowess; and the example of the<br>
men of old hath gone [before them].<br>
9. And if thou [Muhammad] ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth, they<br>
will surely answer: The Mighty, the Knower created them;<br>
10. Who made the earth a resting-place for you, and placed roads for you<br>
therein, that haply ye may find your way;<br>
11. And Who sendeth down water from the sky in [due] measure, and We revive a<br>
dead land therewith. Even so will ye be brought forth;<br>
12. He Who created all the pairs, and appointed for you ships and cattle<br>
whereupon ye ride.<br>
13. That ye may mount upon their backs, and may remember your Lord's favour when<br>
ye mount thereon, and may say: Glorified be He Who hath subdued these unto us,<br>
and we were not capable [of subduing them];<br>
14. And lo! unto our Lord we surely are returning.<br>
15. And they allot to Him a portion of His bondmen! Lo! man is verily a mere<br>
ingrate.<br>
16. Or chooseth He daughters of all that He hath created, and honoureth He you<br>
with sons?<br>
17. And if one of them hath tidings of that which he likeneth to the Beneficent<br>
One, his countenance becometh black and he is full of inward rage.<br>
18. [Liken they then to Allah] that which is bred up in outward show, and in<br>
dispute cannot make itself plain?<br>
19. And they make the angels, who are the slaves of the Beneficent, females. Did<br>
they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded and they will be<br>
questioned.<br>
20. And they say: If the Beneficent One had [so] willed, we should not have<br>
worshipped them. They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do but guess.<br>
21. Or have We given them any scripture before [this Qur'an] so that they are<br>
holding fast thereto?<br>
22. Nay, for they say only: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion, and<br>
we are guided by their footprints.<br>
23. And even so We sent not a warner before thee [Muhammad] into any township<br>
but its luxurious ones said: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion, and<br>
we are following their footprints.<br>
24. [And the warner] said: What! Even though I bring you better guidance than<br>
that ye found your fathers following? They answered: Lo! in what ye bring we are<br>
disbelievers.<br>
25. So We requited them. Then see the nature of the consequence for the<br>
rejecters!<br>
<br>
235<br>
<br>
26. And when Abraham said unto his father and his folk: Lo! I am innocent of<br>
what ye worship<br>
27. Save Him Who did create me, for He will surely guide me.<br>
28. And he made it a word enduring among his seed, that haply they might return.<br>
29. Nay, but I let these and their fathers enjoy life [only] till there should<br>
come unto them the Truth and a messenger making plain.<br>
30. And now that the Truth hath come unto them they say: This is mere magic, and<br>
lo! we are disbelievers therein.<br>
31. And they say: If only this Qur'an had been revealed to some great man of the<br>
two towns?<br>
32. Is it they who apportion thy Lord's mercy? We have apportioned among them<br>
their livelihood in the life of the world, and raised some of them above others<br>
in rank that some of them may take labour from others; and the mercy of thy Lord<br>
is better than [the wealth] that they amass.<br>
33. And were it not that mankind would have become one community, We might well<br>
have appointed, for those who disbelieve in the Beneficent, roofs of silver for<br>
their houses and stairs [of silver] whereby to mount,<br>
34. And for their houses doors [of silver] and couches of silver whereon to<br>
recline,<br>
35. And ornaments of gold. Yet all that would have been but a provision of the<br>
life of the world. And the Hereafter with your Lord would have been for those<br>
who keep from evil.<br>
36. And he whose sight is dim to the remembrance of the Beneficent, We assign<br>
unto him a devil who becometh his comrade;<br>
37. And lo! they surely turn them from the way of Allah, and yet they deem that<br>
they are rightly guided;<br>
38. Till, when he cometh unto Us, he saith [unto his comrade]: Ah, would that<br>
between me and thee there were the distance of the two horizons - an evil<br>
comrade!<br>
39. And it profiteth you not this day, because ye did wrong, that ye will be<br>
sharers in the doom.<br>
40. Canst thou [Muhammad] make the deaf to hear, or canst thou guide the blind<br>
or him who is in error manifest?<br>
41. And if We take thee away, We surely shall take vengeance on them,<br>
42. Or [if] We show thee that wherewith We threaten them; for lo! We have<br>
complete command of them.<br>
43. So hold thou fast to that which is inspired in thee. Lo! thou art on a right<br>
path.<br>
44. And lo! it is in truth a Reminder for thee and for thy folk; and ye will be<br>
questioned.<br>
45. And ask those of Our messengers whom We sent before thee: Did We ever<br>
appoint gods to be worshipped beside the Beneficent?<br>
46. And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations unto Pharaoh and his chiefs,<br>
and he said: I am a messenger of the Lord of the Worlds.<br>
47. But when he brought them Our tokens, behold! they laughed at them.<br>
<br>
236<br>
<br>
48. And every token that We showed them was greater than its sister [token], and<br>
We grasped them with the torment, that haply they might turn again.<br>
49. And they said: O wizard! Entreat thy Lord for us by the pact that He hath<br>
made with thee. Lo! we verily will walk aright.<br>
50. But when We eased them of the torment, behold! they broke their word.<br>
51. And Pharaoh caused a proclamation to be made among his people saying: O my<br>
people! Is not mine the sovereignty of Egypt and these rivers flowing under me?<br>
Can ye not then discern?<br>
52. I am surely better than this fellow, who is despicable and can hardly make<br>
[his meaning] plain!<br>
53. Why, then, have armlets of gold not been set upon him, or angels sent along<br>
with him?<br>
54. Thus he persuaded his people to make light [of Moses], and they obeyed him.<br>
Lo! they were a wanton folk.<br>
55. So, when they angered Us, We punished them and drowned them every one.<br>
56. And We made them a thing past, and an example for those after [them].<br>
57. And when the son of Mary is quoted as an example, behold! the folk laugh<br>
out,<br>
58. And say: Are our gods better, or is he? They raise not the objection save<br>
for argument. Nay! but they are a contentious folk.<br>
59. He is nothing but a slave on whom We bestowed favour, and We made him a<br>
pattern for the Children of Israel.<br>
60. And had We willed We could have set among you angels to be viceroys in the<br>
earth.<br>
61. And lo! verily there is knowledge of the Hour. So doubt ye not concerning<br>
it, but follow Me. This is the right path.<br>
62. And let not Satan turn you aside. Lo! he is an open enemy for you.<br>
63. When Jesus came with clear proofs [of Allah's Sovereignty], he said: I have<br>
come unto you with wisdom, and to make plain some of that concerning which ye<br>
differ. So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me.<br>
64. Lo! Allah, He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is a right<br>
path.<br>
65. But the factions among them differed. Then woe unto those who do wrong from<br>
the doom of a painful day.<br>
66. Await they aught save the Hour, that it shall come upon them suddenly, when<br>
they know not?<br>
67. Friends on that day will be foes one to another, save those who kept their<br>
duty [to Allah].<br>
68. O My slaves! For you there is no fear this day, nor is it ye who grieve;<br>
69. [Ye] who believed Our revelations and were self-surrendered,<br>
70. Enter the Garden, ye and your wives, to be made glad.<br>
71. Therein are brought round for them trays of gold and goblets, and therein is<br>
all that souls desire and eyes find sweet. And ye are immortal therein.<br>
<br>
237<br>
<br>
72. This is the Garden which ye are made to inherit because of what ye used to<br>
do.<br>
73. Therein for you is fruit in plenty whence to eat.<br>
74. Lo! the guilty are immortal in hell's torment.<br>
75. It is not relaxed for them, and they despair therein.<br>
76. We wronged them not, but they it was who did the wrong.<br>
77. And they cry: O master! Let thy Lord make an end of us. He saith: Lo! here<br>
ye must remain.<br>
78. We verily brought the Truth unto you, but ye were, most of you, averse to<br>
the Truth.<br>
79. Or do they determine any thing [against the Prophet]? Lo! We [also] are<br>
determining.<br>
80. Or deem they that We cannot hear their secret thoughts and private<br>
confidences? Nay, but Our envoys, present with them, do record.<br>
81. Say [O Muhammad]: If the Beneficent One hath a son, then, I shall be first<br>
among the worshippers. [But there is no son].<br>
82. Glorified be the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne,<br>
from that which they ascribe [unto Him]!<br>
83. So let them flounder [in their talk] and play until they meet the Day which<br>
they are promised.<br>
84. And He it is Who in the heaven is Allah, and in the earth Allah. He is the<br>
Wise, the Knower.<br>
85. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the<br>
earth and all that is between them, and with Whom is knowledge of the Hour, and<br>
unto Whom ye will be returned.<br>
86. And those unto whom they cry instead of Him possess no power of<br>
intercession, saving him who beareth witness unto the Truth knowingly.<br>
87. And if thou ask them who created them, they will surely say: Allah. How then<br>
are they turned away?<br>
88. And he saith: O my Lord! Lo! these are a folk who believe not.<br>
89. Then bear with them [O Muhammad] and say: Peace. But they will come to know.<br>
<br>
SURA 44. AD-DUKHAN (SMOKE)<br>
1. Ha. Mim.<br>
2. By the Scripture that maketh plain<br>
3. Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night - Lo! We are ever warning 4. Whereon every wise command is made clear<br>
5. As a command from Our presence - Lo! We are ever sending 6. A mercy from thy Lord. Lo! He, even He is the Hearer, the Knower,<br>
7. Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye would<br>
be sure.<br>
<br>
238<br>
<br>
8. There is no Allah save Him. He quickeneth and giveth death; your Lord and<br>
Lord of your forefathers.<br>
9. Nay, but they play in doubt.<br>
10. But watch thou [O Muhammad] for the day when the sky will produce visible<br>
smoke<br>
11. That will envelop the people. This will be a painful torment.<br>
12. [Then they will say]: Our Lord relieve us of the torment. Lo! we are<br>
believers.<br>
13. How can there be remembrance for them, when a messenger making plain [the<br>
Truth] had already come unto them,<br>
14. And they had turned away from him and said: One taught [by others], a<br>
madman?<br>
15. Lo! We withdraw the torment a little. Lo! ye return [to disbelief].<br>
16. On the day when We shall seize them with the greater seizure, [then] in<br>
truth We shall punish.<br>
17. And verily We tried before them Pharaoh's folk, when there came unto them a<br>
noble messenger,<br>
18. Saying: Give up to me the slaves of Allah. Lo! I am a faithful messenger<br>
unto you.<br>
19. And saying: Be not proud against Allah. Lo! I bring you a clear warrant.<br>
20. And lo! I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord lest ye stone me to<br>
death.<br>
21. And if ye put no faith in me, then let me go.<br>
22. And he cried unto his Lord, [saying]: These are guilty folk.<br>
23. Then [his Lord commanded]: Take away My slaves by night. Lo! ye will be<br>
followed,<br>
24. And leave the sea behind at rest, for lo! they are a drowned host.<br>
25. How many were the gardens and the watersprings that they left behind,<br>
26. And the cornlands and the goodly sites<br>
27. And pleasant things wherein they took delight!<br>
28. Even so [it was], and We made it an inheritance for other folk;<br>
29. And the heaven and the earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved.<br>
30. And We delivered the Children of Israel from the shameful doom;<br>
31. [We delivered them] from Pharaoh. Lo! he was a tyrant of the wanton ones.<br>
32. And We chose them, purposely, above [all] creatures.<br>
33. And We gave them portents wherein was a clear trial.<br>
34. Lo! these, forsooth, are saying:<br>
35. There is naught but our first death, and we shall not be raised again.<br>
36. Bring back our fathers, if ye speak the truth!<br>
37. Are they better, or the folk of Tubb'a and those before them? We destroyed<br>
them, for surely they were guilty.<br>
<br>
239<br>
<br>
38. And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,<br>
in play.<br>
39. We created them not save with truth; but most of them know not.<br>
40. Assuredly the Day of Decision is the term for all of them,<br>
41. A day when friend can in naught avail friend, nor can they be helped,<br>
42. Save him on whom Allah hath mercy. Lo! He is the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>
43. Lo! the tree of Zaqqum,<br>
44. The food of the sinner!<br>
45. Like molten brass, it seetheth in their bellies<br>
46. As the seething of boiling water.<br>
47. [And it will be said]: Take him and drag him to the midst of hell,<br>
48. Then pour upon his head the torment of boiling water.<br>
49. [Saying]: Taste! Lo! thou wast forsooth the mighty, the noble!<br>
50. Lo! this is that whereof ye used to doubt.<br>
51. Lo! those who kept their duty will be in a place secured.<br>
52. Amid gardens and watersprings,<br>
53. Attired in silk and silk embroidery, facing one another.<br>
54. Even so [it will be]. And We shall wed them unto fair ones with wide, lovely<br>
eyes.<br>
55. They call therein for every fruit in safety.<br>
56. They taste not death therein, save the first death. And He hath saved them<br>
from the doom of hell,<br>
57. A bounty from thy Lord. That is the supreme triumph.<br>
58. And We have made [this Scripture] easy in thy language only that they may<br>
heed.<br>
59. Wait then [O Muhammad]. Lo! they [too] are waiting.<br>
<br>
SURA 45. AL-JATHIYA (CROUCHING)<br>
1. Ha. Mim.<br>
2. The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
3. Lo! in the heavens and the earth are portents for believers.<br>
4. And in your creation, and all the beasts that He scattereth in the earth, are<br>
portents for a folk whose faith is sure.<br>
5. And the difference of night and day and the provision that Allah sendeth down<br>
from the sky and thereby quickeneth the earth after her death, and the ordering<br>
of the winds, are portents for a people who have sense.<br>
6. These are the portents of Allah which We recite unto thee [Muhammad] with<br>
truth. Then in what fact, after Allah and His portents, will they believe?<br>
7. Woe unto each sinful liar,<br>
<br>
240<br>
<br>
8. Who heareth the revelations of Allah recited unto him, and then continueth in<br>
pride as though he heard them not. Give him tidings of a painful doom.<br>
9. And when he knoweth aught of Our revelations he maketh it a jest. For such<br>
there is a shameful doom.<br>
10. Beyond them there is hell, and that which they have earned will naught avail<br>
them, nor those whom they have chosen for protecting friends beside Allah.<br>
Theirs will be an awful doom.<br>
11. This is guidance. And those who disbelieve the revelations of their Lord,<br>
for them there is a painful doom of wrath.<br>
12. Allah it is Who hath made the sea of service unto you that the ships may run<br>
thereon by His command, and that ye may seek of His bounty, and that haply ye<br>
may be thankful;<br>
13. And hath made of service unto you whatsoever is in the heavens and<br>
whatsoever is in the earth; it is all from Him. Lo! herein verily are portents<br>
for a people who reflect.<br>
14. Tell those who believe to forgive those who hope not for the days of Allah;<br>
in order that He may requite folk what they used to earn.<br>
15. Whoso doeth right, it is for his soul, and whoso doeth wrong, it is against<br>
it. And afterward unto your Lord ye will be brought back.<br>
16. And verily we gave the Children of Israel the Scripture and the Command and<br>
the Prophethood, and provided them with good things and favoured them above<br>
[all] peoples;<br>
17. And gave them plain commandments. And they differed not until after the<br>
knowledge came unto them, through rivalry among themselves. Lo! thy Lord will<br>
judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used<br>
to differ.<br>
18. And now have We set thee [O Muhammad] on a clear road of [Our] commandment;<br>
so follow it, and follow not the whims of those who know not.<br>
19. Lo! they can avail thee naught against Allah. And lo! as for the wrongdoers, some of them are friends of others; and Allah is the Friend of those who<br>
ward off [evil].<br>
20. This is clear indication for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy for a folk<br>
whose faith is sure.<br>
21. Or do those who commit ill-deeds suppose that We shall make them as those<br>
who believe and do good works, the same in life and death? Bad is their<br>
judgment!<br>
22. And Allah hath created the heavens and the earth with truth, and that every<br>
soul may be repaid what it hath earned. And they will not be wronged.<br>
23. Hast thou seen him who maketh his desire his god, and Allah sendeth him<br>
astray purposely, and sealeth up his hearing and his heart, and setteth on his<br>
sight a covering? Then who will lead him after Allah [hath condemned him]? Will<br>
ye not then heed?<br>
24. And they say: There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live,<br>
and naught destroyeth us save time; when they have no knowledge whatsoever of<br>
[all] that; they do but guess.<br>
25. And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them their only argument is<br>
that they say: Bring [back] our fathers. then, if ye are truthful.<br>
<br>
241<br>
<br>
26. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Allah giveth life to you, then causeth you to<br>
die, then gathereth you unto the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt.<br>
But most of mankind know not.<br>
27. And unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; and<br>
on the day when the Hour riseth, on that day those who follow falsehood will be<br>
lost.<br>
28. And thou wilt see each nation crouching, each nation summoned to its record.<br>
[And it will be said unto them]: This day ye are requited what ye used to do.<br>
29. This Our Book pronounceth against you with truth. Lo! We have caused [all]<br>
that ye did to be recorded.<br>
30. Then, as for those who believed and did good works, their Lord will bring<br>
them in unto His mercy. That is the evident triumph.<br>
31. And as for those who disbelieved [it will be said unto them]: Were not Our<br>
revelations recited unto you? But ye were scornful and became a guilty folk.<br>
32. And when it was said: Lo! Allah's promise is the truth, and there is no<br>
doubt of the Hour's coming, ye said: We know not what the Hour is. We deem it<br>
naught but a conjecture, and we are by no means convinced.<br>
33. And the evils of what they did will appear unto them, and that which they<br>
used to deride will befall them.<br>
34. And it will be said: This day We forget you, even as ye forgot the meeting<br>
of this your day; and your habitation is the Fire, and there is none to help<br>
you.<br>
35. This, forasmuch as ye made the revelations of Allah a jest, and the life of<br>
the world beguiled you. Therefor this day they come not forth from thence, nor<br>
can they make amends.<br>
36. Then praise be to Allah, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, the Lord<br>
of the Worlds.<br>
37. And unto Him [alone] belongeth Majesty in the heavens and the earth, and He<br>
is the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
<br>
SURA 46. AL-AHQAF (THE WIND-CURVED SANDHILLS, THE<br>
DUNES)<br>
1. Ha. Mim.<br>
2. The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
3. We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save<br>
with truth, and for a term appointed. But those who disbelieve turn away from<br>
that whereof they are warned.<br>
4. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Have ye thought on all that ye invoke beside<br>
Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth. Or have they any portion in<br>
the heavens? Bring me a scripture before this [Scripture], or some vestige of<br>
knowledge [in support of what ye say], if ye are truthful.<br>
5. And who is further astray than those who, instead of Allah, pray unto such as<br>
hear not their prayer until the Day of Resurrection, and are unconscious of<br>
their prayer,<br>
<br>
242<br>
<br>
6. And when mankind are gathered [to the Judgment] will become enemies for them,<br>
and will become deniers of having been worshipped.<br>
7. And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, those who disbelieve<br>
say of the Truth when it reacheth them: This is mere magic.<br>
8. Or say they: He hath invented it? Say [O Muhammad]: If I have invented it,<br>
still ye have no power to support me against Allah. He is Best Aware of what ye<br>
say among yourselves concerning it. He sufficeth for a witness between me and<br>
you. And He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.<br>
9. Say: I am no new thing among the messengers [of Allah], nor know I what will<br>
be done with me or with you. I do but follow that which is inspired in me, and I<br>
am but a plain warner.<br>
10. Bethink you: If it is from Allah and ye disbelieve therein, and a witness of<br>
the Children of Israel hath already testified to the like thereof and hath<br>
believed, and ye are too proud [what plight is yours]? Lo! Allah guideth not<br>
wrong-doing folk.<br>
11. And those who disbelieve say of those who believe: If it had been [any]<br>
good, they would not have been before us in attaining it. And since they will<br>
not be guided by it, they say: This is an ancient lie;<br>
12. When before it there was the Scripture of Moses, an example and a mercy; and<br>
this is a confirming Scripture in the Arabic language, that it may warn those<br>
who do wrong and bring good tidings for the righteous.<br>
13. Lo! those who say: Our Lord is Allah, and thereafter walk aright, there<br>
shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.<br>
14. Such are rightful owners of the Garden, immortal therein, as a reward for<br>
what they used to do.<br>
15. And We have commended unto man kindness toward parents. His mother beareth<br>
him with reluctance, and bringeth him forth with reluctance, and the bearing of<br>
him and the weaning of him is thirty months, till, when he attaineth full<br>
strength and reacheth forty years, he saith: My Lord! Arouse me that I may give<br>
thanks for the favour wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents, and that I<br>
may do right acceptable unto Thee. And be gracious unto me in the matter of my<br>
seed. Lo! I have turned unto Thee repentant, and lo! I am of those who surrender<br>
[unto Thee].<br>
16. Those are they from whom We accept the best of what they do, and overlook<br>
their evil deeds. [They are] among the owners of the Garden. This is the true<br>
promise which they were promised [in the world].<br>
17. And whoso saith unto his parents: Fie upon you both! Do ye threaten me that<br>
I shall be brought forth [again] when generations before me have passed away?<br>
And they twain cry unto Allah for help [and say]: Woe unto thee! Believe! Lo!<br>
the promise of Allah is true. But he saith: This is naught save fables of the<br>
men of old:<br>
18. Such are those on whom the Word concerning nations of the jinn and mankind<br>
which have passed away before them hath effect. Lo! they are the losers.<br>
19. And for all there will be ranks from what they do, that He may pay them for<br>
their deeds; and they will not be wronged.<br>
20. And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire [it will be<br>
said]: Ye squandered your good things in the life of the world and sought<br>
comfort therein. Now this day ye are rewarded with the doom of ignominy because<br>
<br>
243<br>
<br>
ye were disdainful in the land without a right, and because ye used to<br>
transgress.<br>
21. And make mention [O Muhammad] of the brother of A'ad when he warned his folk<br>
among the wind-curved sandhills - and verily warners came and went before and<br>
after him - saying: Serve none but Allah. Lo! I fear for you the doom of a<br>
tremendous Day.<br>
22. They said: Hast come to turn us away from our gods? Then bring upon us that<br>
wherewith thou threatenest us, if thou art of the truthful.<br>
23. He said: The knowledge is with Allah only. I convey unto you that wherewith<br>
I have been sent, but I see you are a folk that know not.<br>
24. Then, when they beheld it as a dense cloud coming toward their valleys, they<br>
said: Here is a cloud bringing us rain. Nay, but it is that which ye did seek to<br>
hasten, a wind wherein is painful torment,<br>
25. Destroying all things by commandment of its Lord. And morning found them so<br>
that naught could be seen save their dwellings. Thus do We reward the guilty<br>
folk.<br>
26. And verily We had empowered them with that wherewith We have not empowered<br>
you, and had assigned them ears and eyes and hearts; but their ears and eyes and<br>
hearts availed them naught since they denied the revelations of Allah; and what<br>
they used to mock befell them.<br>
27. And verily We have destroyed townships round about you, and displayed [for<br>
them] Our revelation, that haply they might return.<br>
28. Then why did those whom they had chosen for gods as a way of approach [unto<br>
Allah] not help them? Nay, but they did fail them utterly. And [all] that was<br>
their lie, and what they used to invent.<br>
29. And when We inclined toward thee [Muhammad] certain of the jinn, who wished<br>
to hear the Qur'an and, when they were in its presence, said: Give ear! and,<br>
when it was finished, turned back to their people, warning.<br>
30. They said: O our people! Lo! we have heard a scripture which hath been<br>
revealed after Moses, confirming that which was before it, guiding unto the<br>
truth and a right road.<br>
31. O our people! respond to Allah's summoner and believe in Him. He will<br>
forgive you some of your sins and guard you from a painful doom.<br>
32. And whoso respondeth not to Allah's summoner he can nowise escape in the<br>
earth, and he hath no protecting friends instead of Him. Such are in error<br>
manifest.<br>
33. Have they not seen that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and was<br>
not wearied by their creation, is Able to give life to the dead? Aye, He verily<br>
is Able to do all things.<br>
34. And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire [they will<br>
be asked]: Is not this real? They will say: Yea, by our Lord. He will say: Then<br>
taste the doom for that ye disbelieved.<br>
35. Then have patience [O Muhammad] even as the stout of heart among the<br>
messengers [of old] had patience, and seek not to hasten on [the doom] for them.<br>
On the day when they see that which they are promised [it will seem to them] as<br>
though they had tarried but an hour of daylight. A clear message. Shall any be<br>
destroyed save evil-living folk?<br>
<br>
244<br>
<br>
SURA 47. MUHAMMAD (MUHAMMAD)<br>
1. Those who disbelieve and turn [men] from the way of Allah, He rendereth their<br>
actions vain.<br>
2. And those who believe and do good works and believe in that which is revealed<br>
unto Muhammad - and it is the truth from their Lord - He riddeth them of their<br>
ill-deeds and improveth their state.<br>
3. That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and because those who<br>
believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus Allah coineth their similitudes<br>
for mankind.<br>
4. Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the<br>
necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward<br>
either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That [is the<br>
ordinance]. And if Allah willed He could have punished them [without you] but<br>
[thus it is ordained] that He may try some of you by means of others. And those<br>
who are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain.<br>
5. He will guide them and improve their state,<br>
6. And bring them in unto the Garden which He hath made known to them.<br>
7. O ye who believe! If ye help Allah, He will help you and will make your<br>
foothold firm.<br>
8. And those who disbelieve, perdition is for them, and He will make their<br>
actions vain.<br>
9. That is because they are averse to that which Allah hath revealed, therefor<br>
maketh He their actions fruitless.<br>
10. Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for<br>
those who were before them? Allah wiped them out. And for the disbelievers there<br>
will be the like thereof.<br>
11. That is because Allah is patron of those who believe, and because the<br>
disbelievers have no patron.<br>
12. Lo! Allah will cause those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens<br>
underneath which rivers flow; while those who disbelieve take their comfort in<br>
this life and eat even as the cattle eat, and the Fire is their habitation.<br>
13. And how many a township stronger than thy township [O Muhammad] which hath<br>
cast thee out, have We destroyed, and they had no helper!<br>
14. Is he who relieth on a clear proof from his Lord like those for whom the<br>
evil that they do is beautified while they follow their own lusts?<br>
15. A similitude of the Garden which those who keep their duty [to Allah] are<br>
promised: Therein are rivers of water unpolluted, and rivers of milk whereof the<br>
flavour changeth not, and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers, and rivers<br>
of clear-run honey; therein for them is every kind of fruit, with pardon from<br>
their Lord. [Are those who enjoy all this] like those who are immortal in the<br>
Fire and are given boiling water to drink so that it teareth their bowels?<br>
16. Among them are some who give ear unto thee [Muhammad] till, when they go<br>
forth from thy presence they say unto those who have been given knowledge: What<br>
was that he said just now? Those are they whose hearts Allah hath sealed, and<br>
they follow their own lusts.<br>
<br>
245<br>
<br>
17. While as for those who walk aright, He addeth to their guidance, and giveth<br>
them their protection [against evil].<br>
18. Await they aught save the Hour, that it should come upon them unawares? And<br>
the beginnings thereof have already come. But how, when it hath come upon them,<br>
can they take their warning?<br>
19. So know [O Muhammad] that there is no Allah save Allah, and ask forgiveness<br>
for thy sin and for believing men and believing women. Allah knoweth [both] your<br>
place of turmoil and your place of rest.<br>
20. And those who believe say: If only a surah were revealed! But when a<br>
decisive surah is revealed and war is mentioned therein, thou seest those in<br>
whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with the look of men fainting unto<br>
death. Therefor woe unto them!<br>
21. Obedience and a civil word. Then, when the matter is determined, if they are<br>
loyal to Allah it will be well for them.<br>
22. Would ye then, if ye were given the command, work corruption in the land and<br>
sever your ties of kinship?<br>
23. Such are they whom Allah curseth so that He deafeneth them and maketh blind<br>
their eyes.<br>
24. Will they then not meditate on the Qur'an, or are there locks on the hearts?<br>
25. Lo! those who turn back after the guidance hath been manifested unto them,<br>
Satan hath seduced them, and He giveth them the rein.<br>
26. That is because they say unto those who hate what Allah hath revealed: We<br>
will obey you in some matters; and Allah knoweth their secret talk.<br>
27. Then how [will it be with them] when the angels gather them, smiting their<br>
faces and their backs!<br>
28. That will be because they followed that which angereth Allah, and hated that<br>
which pleaseth Him. Therefor He hath made their actions vain.<br>
29. Or do those in whose hearts is a disease deem that Allah will not bring to<br>
light their [secret] hates?<br>
30. And if We would, We could show them unto thee [Muhammad] so that thou<br>
shouldst know them surely by their marks. And thou shalt know them by the burden<br>
of their talk. And Allah knoweth your deeds.<br>
31. And verily We shall try you till We know those of you who strive hard [for<br>
the cause of Allah] and the steadfast, and till We test your record.<br>
32. Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from the way of Allah and oppose the<br>
messenger after the guidance hath been manifested unto them, they hurt Allah not<br>
a jot, and He will make their actions fruitless.<br>
33. O ye who believe! Obey Allah and obey the messenger, and render not your<br>
actions vain.<br>
34. Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from the way of Allah and then die<br>
disbelievers, Allah surely will not pardon them.<br>
35. So do not falter and cry out for peace when ye [will be] the uppermost, and<br>
Allah is with you, and He will not grudge [the reward of] your actions.<br>
36. The life of the world is but a sport and a pastime. And if ye believe and<br>
ward off [evil]. He will give you your wages, and will not ask of you your<br>
wordly wealth.<br>
<br>
246<br>
<br>
37. If He should ask it of you and importune you, ye would hoard it, and He<br>
would bring to light your [secret] hates.<br>
38. Lo! ye are those who are called to spend in the way of Allah, yet among you<br>
there are some who hoard. And as for him who hoardeth, he hoardeth only from his<br>
soul. And Allah is the Rich, and ye are the poor. And if ye turn away He will<br>
exchange you for some other folk, and they will not be the likes of you.<br>
<br>
SURA 48. AL-FATH (VICTORY, CONQUEST)<br>
1. Lo! We have given thee [O Muhammad] a signal victory,<br>
2. That Allah may forgive thee of thy sin that which is past and that which is<br>
to come, and may perfect His favour unto thee, and may guide thee on a right<br>
path,<br>
3. And that Allah may help thee with strong help 4. He it is Who sent down peace of reassurance into the hearts of the believers<br>
that they might add faith unto their faith. Allah's are the hosts of the heavens<br>
and the earth, and Allah is ever Knower, Wise 5. That He may bring the believing men and the believing women into Gardens<br>
underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide, and may remit from them<br>
their evil deeds - That, in the sight of Allah, is the supreme triumph 6. And may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the<br>
idolatrous men and the idolatrous women, who think an evil thought concerning<br>
Allah. For them is the evil turn of fortune, and Allah is wroth against them and<br>
hath cursed them, and hath made ready for them hell, a hapless journey's end.<br>
7. Allah's are the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is ever Mighty,<br>
Wise.<br>
8. Lo! We have sent thee [O Muhammad] as a witness and a bearer of good tidings<br>
and a warner,<br>
9. That ye [mankind] may believe in Allah and His messenger, and may honour Him,<br>
and may revere Him, and may glorify Him at early dawn and at the close of day.<br>
10. Lo! those who swear allegiance unto thee [Muhammad], swear allegiance only<br>
unto Allah. The Hand of Allah is above their hands. So whosoever breaketh his<br>
oath, breaketh it only to his soul's hurt; while whosoever keepeth his covenant<br>
with Allah, on him will He bestow immense reward.<br>
11. Those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind will tell thee: Our<br>
possessions and our households occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us! They<br>
speak with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. Say: Who can avail<br>
you aught against Allah, if He intend you hurt or intend you profit? Nay, but<br>
Allah is ever Aware of what ye do.<br>
12. Nay, but ye deemed that the messenger and the believers would never return<br>
to their own folk, and that was made fairseeming in your hearts, and ye did<br>
think an evil thought, and ye were worthless folk.<br>
13. And so for him who believeth not in Allah and His messenger - Lo! We have<br>
prepared a flame for disbelievers.<br>
14. And Allah's is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He forgiveth<br>
whom He will, and punisheth whom He will. And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
15. Those who were left behind will say, when ye set forth to capture booty: Let<br>
us go with you. They fain would change the verdict of Allah. Say [unto them, O<br>
247<br>
<br>
Muhammad]: Ye shall not go with us. Thus hath Allah said beforehand. Then they<br>
will say: Ye are envious of us. Nay, but they understand not, save a little.<br>
16. Say unto those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind: Ye will be<br>
called against a folk of mighty prowess, to fight them until they surrender; and<br>
if ye obey, Allah will give you a fair reward; but if ye turn away as ye did<br>
turn away before, He will punish you with a painful doom.<br>
17. There is no blame for the blind, nor is there blame for the lame, nor is<br>
there blame for the sick [that they go not forth to war]. And whoso obeyeth<br>
Allah and His messenger, He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers<br>
flow; and whoso turneth back, him will He punish with a painful doom.<br>
18. Allah was well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance unto<br>
thee beneath the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down<br>
peace of reassurance on them, and hath rewarded them with a near victory;<br>
19. And much booty that they will capture. Allah is ever Mighty, Wise.<br>
20. Allah promiseth you much booty that ye will capture, and hath given you this<br>
in advance, and hath withheld men's hands from you, that it may be a token for<br>
the believers, and that He may guide you on a right path.<br>
21. And other [gain], which ye have not been able to achieve, Allah will compass<br>
it, Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
22. And if those who disbelieve join battle with you they will take to flight,<br>
and afterward they will find no protecting friend nor helper.<br>
23. It is the law of Allah which hath taken course aforetime. Thou wilt not find<br>
for the law of Allah aught of power to change.<br>
24. And He it is Who hath withheld men's hands from you, and hath withheld your<br>
hands from them, in the valley of Mecca, after He had made you victors over<br>
them. Allah is Seer of what ye do.<br>
25. These it was who disbelieved and debarred you from the Inviolable Place of<br>
Worship, and debarred the offering from reaching its goal. And if it had not<br>
been for believing men and believing women, whom ye know not - lest ye should<br>
tread them under foot and thus incur guilt for them unknowingly; that Allah<br>
might bring into His mercy whom He will - If [the believers and the<br>
disbelievers] had been clearly separated We verily had punished those of them<br>
who disbelieved with painful punishment.<br>
26. When those who disbelieve had set up in their hearts zealotry, the zealotry<br>
of the Age of Ignorance, then Allah sent down His peace of reassurance upon His<br>
messenger and upon the believers and imposed on them the word of self-restraint,<br>
for they were worthy of it and meet for it. And Allah is Aware of all things.<br>
27. Allah hath fulfilled the vision for His messenger in very truth. Ye shall<br>
indeed enter the Inviolable Place of Worship, if Allah will, secure, [having<br>
your hair] shaven and cut, not fearing. But He knoweth that which ye know not,<br>
and hath given you a near victory beforehand.<br>
28. He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of<br>
truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion. And Allah sufficeth as<br>
a Witness.<br>
29. Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard against the<br>
disbelievers and merciful among themselves. Thou [O Muhammad] seest them bowing<br>
and falling prostrate [in worship], seeking bounty from Allah and [His]<br>
acceptance. The mark of them is on their foreheads from the traces of<br>
prostration. Such is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the<br>
<br>

Gospel - like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and<br>
riseth firm upon its stalk, delighting the sowers – that He may enrage the<br>
disbelievers with [the sight of] them. Allah hath promised, unto such of them as<br>
believe and do good works, forgiveness and immense reward.<br>
<br>
SURA 49. AL-HUJRAAT (THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS, THE<br>
INNER APARTMENTS)<br>
1. O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah and His messenger,<br>
and keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower.<br>
2. O ye who believe! Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor<br>
shout when speaking to him as ye shout one to another, lest your works be<br>
rendered vain while ye perceive not.<br>
3. Lo! they who subdue their voices in the presence of the messenger of Allah,<br>
those are they whose hearts Allah hath proven unto righteousness. Theirs will be<br>
forgiveness and immense reward.<br>
4. Lo! those who call thee from behind the private apartments, most of them have<br>
no sense.<br>
5. And if they had had patience till thou camest forth unto them, it had been<br>
better for them. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
6. O ye who believe! If an evil-liver bring you tidings, verify it, lest ye<br>
smite some folk in ignorance and afterward repent of what ye did.<br>
7. And know that the messenger of Allah<br>
much of the government, ye would surely<br>
the faith to you and hath beautified it<br>
and lewdness and rebellion hateful unto<br>
guided.<br>
<br>
is among you. If he were to obey you in<br>
be in trouble; but Allah hath endeared<br>
in your hearts, and hath made disbelief<br>
you. Such are they who are the rightly<br>
<br>
8. [It is] a bounty and a grace from Allah; and Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
9. And if two parties of believers fall to fighting, then make peace between<br>
them. And if one party of them doeth wrong to the other, fight ye that which<br>
doeth wrong till it return unto the ordinance of Allah; then, if it return, make<br>
peace between them justly, and act equitably. Lo! Allah loveth the equitable.<br>
10. The believers are naught else than brothers. Therefore make peace between<br>
your brethren and observe your duty to Allah that haply ye may obtain mercy.<br>
11. O ye who believe! Let not a folk deride a folk who may be better than they<br>
[are], not let women [deride] women who may be better than they are; neither<br>
defame one another, nor insult one another by nicknames. Bad is the name of<br>
lewdness after faith. And whoso turneth not in repentance, such are evil-doers.<br>
12. O ye who believe! Shun much suspicion; for lo! some suspicion is a crime.<br>
And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would one of you love to eat the<br>
flesh of his dead brother? Ye abhor that [so abhor the other]! And keep your<br>
duty [to Allah]. Lo! Allah is Relenting, Merciful.<br>
13. O mankind! Lo! We have created you male and female, and have made you<br>
nations and tribes that ye may know one another. Lo! the noblest of you, in the<br>
sight of Allah, is the best in conduct. Lo! Allah is Knower, Aware.<br>
14. The wandering Arabs say: We believe. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Ye believe<br>
not, but rather say "We submit," for the faith hath not yet entered into your<br>
<br>
249<br>
<br>
hearts. Yet, if ye obey Allah and His messenger, He will not withhold from you<br>
aught of [the reward of] your deeds. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
15. The [true] believers are those only who believe in Allah and His messenger<br>
and afterward doubt not, but strive with their wealth and their lives for the<br>
cause of Allah. Such are the sincere.<br>
16. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Would ye teach Allah your religion, when Allah<br>
knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and Allah is<br>
Aware of all things?<br>
17. They make it a favour unto thee [Muhammad] that they have surrendered [unto<br>
Him]. Say: Deem not your Surrender a favour unto me; but Allah doth confer a<br>
favour on you, inasmuch as He hath led you to the Faith, if ye are earnest.<br>
18. Lo! Allah knoweth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Seer<br>
of what ye do.<br>
<br>
SURA 50. QAF (THE LETTER QAF)<br>
1. Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an,<br>
2. Nay, but they marvel that a warner of their own hath come unto them; and the<br>
disbelievers say: This is a strange thing:<br>
3. When we are dead and have become dust [shall we be brought back again]? That<br>
would be a far return!<br>
4. We know that which the earth taketh of them, and with Us is a recording Book.<br>
5. Nay, but they have denied the truth when it came unto them, therefor they are<br>
now in troubled case.<br>
6. Have they not then observed the sky above them, how We have constructed it<br>
and beautified it, and how there are no rifts therein?<br>
7. And the earth have We spread out, and have flung firm hills therein, and have<br>
caused of every lovely kind to grow thereon,<br>
8. A vision and a reminder for every penitent slave.<br>
9. And We send down from the sky blessed water whereby We give growth unto<br>
gardens and the grain of crops,<br>
10. And lofty date-palms with ranged clusters,<br>
11. Provision [made] for men; and therewith We quicken a dead land. Even so will<br>
be the resurrection of the dead.<br>
12. The folk of Noah denied [the truth] before them, and [so did] the dwellers<br>
at Ar-Rass and [the tribe of] Thamud,<br>
13. And [the tribe of] A'ad, and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot,<br>
14. And the dwellers in the wood, and the folk of Tubb'a: every one denied their<br>
messengers, therefor My threat took effect.<br>
15. Were We then worn out by the first creation? Yet they are in doubt about a<br>
new creation.<br>
16. We verily created man and We know what his soul whispereth to him, and We<br>
are nearer to him than his jugular vein.<br>
17. When the two Receivers receive [him], seated on the right hand and on the<br>
left,<br>
<br>
250<br>
<br>
18. He uttereth no word but there is with him an observer ready.<br>
19. And the agony of death cometh in truth. [And it is said unto him]: This is<br>
that which thou wast wont to shun.<br>
20. And the trumpet is blown. This is the threatened Day.<br>
21. And every soul cometh, along with it a driver and a witness.<br>
22. [And unto the evil-doer it is said]: Thou wast in heedlessness of this. Now<br>
We have removed from thee thy covering, and piercing is thy sight this day.<br>
23. And [unto the evil-doer] his comrade saith: This is that which I have ready<br>
[as testimony].<br>
24. [And it is said]: Do ye twain hurl to hell each rebel ingrate,<br>
25. Hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter,<br>
26. Who setteth up another god along with Allah. Do ye twain hurl him to the<br>
dreadful doom.<br>
27. His comrade saith: Our Lord! I did not cause him to rebel, but he was<br>
[himself] far gone in error.<br>
28. He saith: Contend not in My presence, when I had already proffered unto you<br>
the warning.<br>
29. The sentence that cometh from Me cannot be changed, and I am in no wise a<br>
tyrant unto the slaves.<br>
30. On the day when We say unto hell: Art thou filled? and it saith: Can there<br>
be more to come?<br>
31. And the Garden is brought nigh for those who kept from evil, no longer<br>
distant.<br>
32. [And it is said]: This is that which ye were promised. [It is] for every<br>
penitent and heedful one,<br>
33. Who feareth the Beneficent in secret and cometh with a contrite heart.<br>
34. Enter it in peace. This is the day of immortality.<br>
35. There they have all that they desire, and there is more with Us.<br>
36. And how many a generation We destroyed before them, who were mightier than<br>
these in prowess so that they overran the lands! Had they any place of refuge<br>
[when the judgment came]?<br>
37. Lo! therein verily is a reminder for him who hath a heart, or giveth ear<br>
with full intelligence.<br>
38. And verily We created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between<br>
them, in six Days, and naught of weariness touched Us.<br>
39. Therefor [O Muhammad] bear with what they say, and hymn the praise of thy<br>
Lord before the rising and before the setting of the sun;<br>
40. And in the night-time hymn His praise, and after the [prescribed]<br>
prostrations.<br>
41. And listen on the day when the crier crieth from a near place,<br>
42. The day when they will hear the [Awful] Cry in truth. That is the day of<br>
coming forth [from the graves].<br>
43. Lo! We it is Who quicken and give death, and unto Us is the journeying.<br>
<br>
251<br>
<br>
44. On the day when the earth splitteth asunder from them, hastening forth [they<br>
come]. That is a gathering easy for Us [to make].<br>
45. We are Best Aware of what they say, and thou [O Muhammad] art in no wise a<br>
compeller over them. But warn by the Qur'an him who feareth My threat.<br>
<br>
SURA 51. ADH-DHARIYAT (THE WINNOWING WINDS)<br>
1. By those that winnow with a winnowing<br>
2. And those that bear the burden [of the rain]<br>
3. And those that glide with ease [upon the sea]<br>
4. And those who distribute [blessings] by command,<br>
5. Lo! that wherewith ye are threatened is indeed true,<br>
6. And lo! the judgment will indeed befall.<br>
7. By the heaven full of paths,<br>
8. Lo! ye, forsooth, are of various opinion [concerning the truth].<br>
9. He is made to turn away from it who is [himself] averse.<br>
10. Accursed be the conjecturers<br>
11. Who are careless in an abyss!<br>
12. They ask: When is the Day of Judgment?<br>
13. [It is] the day when they will be tormented at the Fire,<br>
14. [And it will be said unto them]: Taste your torment [which ye inflicted].<br>
This is what ye sought to hasten.<br>
15. Lo! those who keep from evil will dwell amid gardens and watersprings,<br>
16. Taking that which their Lord giveth them; for lo! aforetime they were doers<br>
of good;<br>
17. They used to sleep but little of the night,<br>
18. And ere the dawning of each day would seek forgiveness,<br>
19. And in their wealth the beggar and the outcast had due share.<br>
20. And in the earth are portents for those whose faith is sure.<br>
21. And [also] in yourselves. Can ye then not see?<br>
22. And in the heaven is your providence and that which ye are promised;<br>
23. And by the Lord of the heavens and the earth, it is the truth, even as [it<br>
is true] that ye speak.<br>
24. Hath the story of Abraham's honoured guests reached thee [O Muhammad]?<br>
25. When they came in unto him and said: Peace! he answered, Peace! [and<br>
thought]: Folk unknown [to me].<br>
26. Then he went apart unto his housefolk so that they brought a fatted calf;<br>
27. And he set it before them, saying: Will ye not eat?<br>
28. Then he conceived a fear of them. They said: Fear not! and gave him tidings<br>
of [the birth of] a wise son.<br>
<br>
252<br>
<br>
29. Then his wife came forward, making moan, and smote her face, and cried: A<br>
barren old woman!<br>
30. They said: Even so saith thy Lord. Lo! He is the Wise, the Knower.<br>
31. [Abraham] said: And [afterward] what is your errand, O ye sent [from Allah]?<br>
32. They said: Lo! we are sent unto a guilty folk,<br>
33. That we may send upon them stones of clay,<br>
34. Marked by thy Lord for [the destruction of] the wanton.<br>
35. Then we brought forth such believers as were there.<br>
36. But We found there but one house of those surrendered [to Allah].<br>
37. And We left behind therein a portent for those who fear a painful doom.<br>
38. And in Moses [too, there is a portent] when We sent him unto Pharaoh with<br>
clear warrant,<br>
39. But he withdrew [confiding] in his might, and said: A wizard or a madman.<br>
40. So We seized him and his hosts and flung them in the sea, for he was<br>
reprobate.<br>
41. And in [the tribe of] A'ad [there is a portent] when we sent the fatal wind<br>
against them.<br>
42. It spared naught that it reached, but made it [all] as dust.<br>
43. And in [the tribe of] Thamud [there is a portent] when it was told them:<br>
Take your ease awhile.<br>
44. But they rebelled against their Lord's decree, and so the thunderbolt<br>
overtook them even while they gazed;<br>
45. And they were unable to rise up, nor could they help themselves.<br>
46. And the folk of Noah aforetime. Lo! they were licentious folk.<br>
47. We have built the heaven with might, and We it is Who make the vast extent<br>
[thereof].<br>
48. And the earth have We laid out, how gracious is the Spreader [thereof]!<br>
49. And all things We have created by pairs, that haply ye may reflect.<br>
50. Therefor flee unto Allah; lo! I am a plain warner unto you from him.<br>
51. And set not any other god along with Allah; lo! I am a plain warner unto you<br>
from Him.<br>
52. Even so there came no messenger unto those before them but they said: A<br>
wizard or a madman!<br>
53. Have they handed down [the saying] as an heirloom one unto another? Nay, but<br>
they are froward folk.<br>
54. So withdraw from them [O Muhammad], for thou art in no wise blameworthy,<br>
55. And warn, for warning profiteth believers.<br>
56. I created the jinn and humankind only that they might worship Me.<br>
57. I seek no livelihood from them, nor do I ask that they should feed Me.<br>
58. Lo! Allah! He it is that giveth livelihood, the Lord of unbreakable might.<br>
<br>
253<br>
<br>
59. And lo! for those who [now] do wrong there is an evil day like unto the evil<br>
day [which came for] their likes [of old]; so let them not ask Me to hasten on<br>
[that day].<br>
60. And woe unto those who disbelieve, from [that] their day which they are<br>
promised.<br>
<br>
SURA 52. AT-TUR (THE MOUNT)<br>
1. By the Mount,<br>
2. And a Scripture inscribed<br>
3. On fine parchment unrolled,<br>
4. And the House frequented,<br>
5. And the roof exalted,<br>
6. And the sea kept filled,<br>
7. Lo! the doom of thy Lord will surely come to pass;<br>
8. There is none that can ward it off.<br>
9. On the day when the heaven will heave with [awful] heaving,<br>
10. And the mountains move away with [awful] movement,<br>
11. Then woe that day unto the deniers<br>
12. Who play in talk of grave matters;<br>
13. The day when they are thrust with a [disdainful] thrust, into the fire of<br>
hell<br>
14. [And it is said unto them]: This is the Fire which ye were wont to deny.<br>
15. Is this magic, or do ye not see?<br>
16. Endure the heat thereof, and whether ye are patient of it or impatient of it<br>
is all one for you. Ye are only being paid for what ye used to do.<br>
17. Lo! those who kept their duty dwell in gardens and delight,<br>
18. Happy because of what their Lord hath given them, and [because] their Lord<br>
hath warded off from them the torment of hell-fire.<br>
19. [And it is said unto them]: Eat and drink in health [as a reward] for what<br>
ye used to do,<br>
20. Reclining on ranged couches. And we wed them unto fair ones with wide,<br>
lovely eyes.<br>
21. And they who believe and whose seed follow them in faith, We cause their<br>
seed to join them [there], and We deprive them of nought of their [life's] work.<br>
Every man is a pledge for that which he hath earned.<br>
22. And We provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire.<br>
23. There they pass from hand to hand a cup wherein is neither vanity nor cause<br>
of sin.<br>
24. And there go round, waiting on them menservants of their own, as they were<br>
hidden pearls.<br>
25. And some of them draw near unto others, questioning,<br>
<br>
254<br>
<br>
26. Saying: Lo! of old, when we were with our families, we were ever anxious;<br>
27. But Allah hath been gracious unto us and hath preserved us from the torment<br>
of the breath of Fire.<br>
28. Lo! we used to pray unto Him of old. Lo! He is the Benign, the Merciful.<br>
29. Therefor warn [men, O Muhammad]. By the grace of Allah thou art neither<br>
soothsayer nor madman.<br>
30. Or say they: [he is] a poet, [one] for whom we may expect the accident of<br>
time?<br>
31. Say [unto them]: Except [your fill]! Lo! I am with you among the expectant.<br>
32. Do their minds command them to do this, or are they an outrageous folk?<br>
33. Or say they: He hath invented it? Nay, but they will not believe!<br>
34. Then let them produce speech the like thereof, if they are truthful.<br>
35. Or were they created out of naught? Or are they the creators?<br>
36. Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they are sure of<br>
nothing!<br>
37. Or do they own the treasures of thy Lord? Or have they been given charge<br>
[thereof]?<br>
38. Or have they any stairway [unto heaven] by means of which they overhear<br>
[decrees]. Then let their listener produce some warrant manifest!<br>
39. Or hath He daughters whereas ye have sons?<br>
40. Or askest thou [Muhammad] a fee from them so that they are plunged in debt?<br>
41. Or possess they the Unseen so that they can write [it] down?<br>
42. Or seek they to ensnare [the messenger]? But those who disbelieve, they are<br>
the ensnared!<br>
43. Or have they any god beside Allah? Glorified be Allah from all that they<br>
ascribe as partner [unto Him]!<br>
44. And if they were to see a fragment of the heaven falling, they would say: A<br>
heap of clouds.<br>
45. Then let them be [O Muhammad], till they meet their day, in which they will<br>
be thunder-stricken,<br>
46. A day in which their guile will naught avail them, nor will they be helped.<br>
47. And verily, for those who do wrong, there is a punishment beyond that. But<br>
most of them know not.<br>
48. So wait patiently [O Muhammad] for thy Lord's decree, for surely thou art in<br>
Our sight; and hymn the praise of thy Lord when thou uprisest,<br>
49. And in the night-time also hymn His praise, and at the setting of the stars.<br>
<br>
SURA 53. AN-NAJM (THE STAR)<br>
1. By the Star when it setteth,<br>
2. Your comrade erreth not, nor is deceived;<br>
3. Nor doth he speak of [his own] desire.<br>
<br>
255<br>
<br>
4. It is naught save an inspiration that is inspired,<br>
5. Which one of mighty powers hath taught him,<br>
6. One vigorous; and he grew clear to view<br>
7. When he was on the uppermost horizon.<br>
8. Then he drew nigh and came down<br>
9. Till he was [distant] two bows' length or even nearer,<br>
10. And He revealed unto His slave that which He revealed.<br>
11. The heart lied not [in seeing] what it saw.<br>
12. Will ye then dispute with him concerning what he seeth?<br>
13. And verily he saw him yet another time<br>
14. By the lote-tree of the utmost boundary,<br>
15. Nigh unto which is the Garden of Abode.<br>
16. When that which shroudeth did enshroud the lote-tree,<br>
17. The eye turned not aside nor yet was overbold.<br>
18. Verily he saw one of the greater revelations of his Lord.<br>
19. Have ye thought upon Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza<br>
20. And Manat, the third, the other?<br>
21. Are yours the males and His the females?<br>
22. That indeed were an unfair division!<br>
23. They are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which Allah<br>
hath revealed no warrant. They follow but a guess and that which [they]<br>
themselves desire. And now the guidance from their Lord hath come unto them.<br>
24. Or shall man have what he coveteth?<br>
25. But unto Allah belongeth the after [life], and the former.<br>
26. And how many angels are in the heavens whose intercession availeth naught<br>
save after Allah giveth leave to whom He chooseth and accepteth.<br>
27. Lo! it is those who disbelieve in the Hereafter who name the angels with the<br>
names of females.<br>
28. And they have no knowledge thereof. They follow but a guess, and lo! a guess<br>
can never take the place of the truth.<br>
29. Then withdraw [O Muhammad] from him who fleeth from Our remembrance and<br>
desireth but the life of the world.<br>
30. Such is their sum of knowledge. Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who<br>
strayeth, and He is Best Aware of him whom goeth right.<br>
31. And unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in<br>
the earth, that He may reward those who do evil with that which they have done,<br>
and reward those who do good with goodness.<br>
32. Those who avoid enormities of sin and abominations, save the unwilled<br>
offences - [for them] lo! thy Lord is of vast mercy. He is Best Aware of you<br>
[from the time] when He created you from the earth, and when ye were hidden in<br>
the bellies of your mothers. Therefor ascribe not purity unto yourselves. He is<br>
Best Aware of him who wardeth off [evil].<br>
<br>
256<br>
<br>
33. Didst thou [O Muhammad] observe him who turned away,<br>
34. And gave a little, then was grudging?<br>
35. Hath he knowledge of the Unseen so that he seeth?<br>
36. Or hath he not had news of what is in the books of Moses<br>
37. And Abraham who paid his debt:<br>
38. That no laden one shall bear another's load,<br>
39. And that man hath only that for which he maketh effort,<br>
40. And that his effort will be seen.<br>
41. And afterward he will be repaid for it with fullest payment;<br>
42. And that thy Lord, He is the goal;<br>
43. And that He it is who maketh laugh, and maketh weep,<br>
44. And that He it is Who giveth death and giveth life;<br>
45. And that He createth the two spouses, the male and the female,<br>
46. From a drop [of seed] when it is poured forth;<br>
47. And that He hath ordained the second bringing forth;<br>
48. And that He it is Who enricheth and contenteth;<br>
49. And that He it is Who is the Lord of Sirius;<br>
50. And that He destroyed the former [tribe of] A'ad,<br>
51. And [the tribe of] Thamud He spared not;<br>
52. And the folk of Noah aforetime, Lo! they were more unjust and more<br>
rebellious;<br>
53. And Al-Mu'tafikah He destroyed<br>
54. So that there covered them that which did cover.<br>
55. Concerning which then, of the bounties of thy Lord, canst thou dispute?<br>
56. This is a warner of the warners of old.<br>
57. The threatened Hour is nigh.<br>
58. None beside Allah can disclose it.<br>
59. Marvel ye then at this statement,<br>
60. And laugh and not weep,<br>
61. While ye amuse yourselves?<br>
62. Rather prostrate yourselves before Allah and serve Him.<br>
<br>
SURA 54. AL-QAMAR (THE MOON)<br>
1. The hour drew nigh and the moon was rent in twain.<br>
2. And if they behold a portent they turn away and say: Prolonged illusion.<br>
3. They denied [the Truth] and followed their own lusts. Yet everything will<br>
come to a decision<br>
4. And surely there hath come unto them news whereof the purport should deter,<br>
257<br>
<br>
5. Effective wisdom; but warnings avail not.<br>
6. So withdraw from them [O Muhammad] on the day when the Summoner summoneth<br>
unto a painful thing.<br>
7. With downcast eyes, they come forth from the graves as they were locusts<br>
spread abroad,<br>
8. Hastening toward the summoner; the disbelievers say: This is a hard day.<br>
9. The folk of Noah denied before them, yea, they denied Our slave and said: A<br>
madman; and he was repulsed.<br>
10. So he cried unto his Lord, saying: I am vanquished, so give help.<br>
11. Then opened We the gates of heaven with pouring water<br>
12. And caused the earth to gush forth springs, so that the waters met for a<br>
predestined purpose.<br>
13. And We carried him upon a thing of planks and nails,<br>
14. That ran [upon the waters] in Our sight, as a reward for him who was<br>
rejected.<br>
15. And verily We left it as a token; but is there any that remembereth?<br>
16. Then see how [dreadful] was My punishment after My warnings!<br>
17. And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that<br>
remembereth?<br>
18. [The tribe of] A'ad rejected warnings. Then how [dreadful] was My punishment<br>
after My warnings.<br>
19. Lo! We let loose on them a raging wind on a day of constant calamity,<br>
20. Sweeping men away as though they were uprooted trunks of palm-trees.<br>
21. Then see how [dreadful] was My punishment after My warnings!<br>
22. And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that<br>
remembereth?<br>
23. [The tribe of] Thamud rejected warnings<br>
24. For they said; Is it a mortal man, alone among us, that we are to follow?<br>
Then indeed we should fall into error and madness.<br>
25. Hath the remembrance been given unto him alone among us? Nay, but he is a<br>
rash liar.<br>

liar.<br>
27. Lo! We are sending the she-camel as a test for them; so watch them and have<br>
patience;<br>
28. And inform them that the water is to be shared between [her and] them. Every<br>
drinking will be witnessed.<br>
29. But they call their comrade and he took and hamstrung [her].<br>
30. Then see how [dreadful] was My punishment after My warnings!<br>
31. Lo! We sent upon them one Shout, and they became as the dry twigs [rejected<br>
by] the builder of a cattle-fold.<br>
<br>
258<br>
<br>
32. And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that<br>
remembereth?<br>
33. The folk of Lot rejected warnings.<br>
34. Lo! We sent a storm of stones upon them [all] save the family of Lot, whom<br>
We rescued in the last watch of the night,<br>
35. As grace from Us. Thus We reward him who giveth thanks.<br>
36. And he indeed had warned them of Our blow, but they did doubt the warnings.<br>
37. They even asked of him his guests for an ill purpose. Then We blinded their<br>
eyes [and said]: Taste now My punishment after My warnings!<br>
38. And in truth the punishment decreed befell them early in the morning.<br>
39. Now taste My punishment after My warnings!<br>
40. And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that<br>
remembereth?<br>
41. And warnings came in truth unto the house of Pharaoh<br>
42. Who denied Our revelations, every one. Therefore We grasped them with the<br>
grasp of the Mighty, the Powerful.<br>
43. Are your disbelievers better than those, or have ye some immunity in the<br>
scriptures?<br>
44. Or say they: We are a host victorious?<br>
45. The hosts will all be routed and will turn and flee.<br>
46. Nay, but the Hour [of doom] is their appointed tryst, and the Hour will be<br>
more wretched and more bitter [than their earthly failure].<br>
47. Lo! the guilty are in error and madness.<br>
48. On the day when they are dragged into the Fire upon their faces [it is said<br>
unto them]: Feel the touch of hell.<br>
49. Lo! We have created every thing by measure.<br>
50. And Our commandment is but one [commandment], as the twinkling of an eye.<br>
51. And verily We have destroyed your fellows; but is there any that<br>
remembereth?<br>
52. And every thing they did is in the scriptures,<br>
53. And every small and great thing is recorded.<br>
54. Lo! the righteous will dwell among gardens and rivers,<br>
55. Firmly established in the favour of a Mighty King.<br>

SURA 56. AL-WAQIA (THE EVENT, THE INEVITABLE)<br>
1. When the event befalleth 2. There is no denying that it will befall 3. Abasing [some], exalting [others];<br>
4. When the earth is shaken with a shock<br>
5. And the hills are ground to powder<br>
6. So that they become a scattered dust,<br>
7. And ye will be three kinds:<br>
8. [First] those on the right hand; what of those on the right hand?<br>
9. And [then] those on the left hand; what of those on the left hand?<br>
10. And the foremost in the race, the foremost in the race:<br>
11. Those are they who will be brought nigh<br>
12. In gardens of delight;<br>
13. A multitude of those of old<br>
14. And a few of those of later time.<br>
15. On lined couches,<br>
16. Reclining therein face to face.<br>
17. There wait on them immortal youths<br>
18. With bowls and ewers and a cup from a pure spring<br>
19. Wherefrom they get no aching of the head nor any madness,<br>
20. And fruit that they prefer<br>
21. And flesh of fowls that they desire.<br>
22. And [there are] fair ones with wide, lovely eyes,<br>
23. Like unto hidden pearls,<br>
24. Reward for what they used to do.<br>
25. There hear they no vain speaking nor recrimination<br>
26. [Naught] but the saying: Peace, [and again] Peace.<br>
27. And those on the right hand; what of those on the right hand?<br>
28. Among thornless lote-trees<br>
29. And clustered plantains,<br>
30. And spreading shade,<br>
31. And water gushing,<br>
<br>
262<br>
<br>
32. And fruit in plenty<br>
33. Neither out of reach nor yet forbidden,<br>
34. And raised couches;<br>
35. Lo! We have created them a [new] creation<br>
36. And made them virgins,<br>
37. Lovers, friends,<br>
38. For those on the right hand;<br>
39. A multitude of those of old<br>
40. And a multitude of those of later time.<br>
41. And those on the left hand: What of those on the left hand?<br>
42. In scorching wind and scalding water<br>
43. And shadow of black smoke,<br>
44. Neither cool nor refreshing.<br>
45. Lo! heretofore they were effete with luxury<br>
46. And used to persist in the awful sin.<br>
47. And they used to say: When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall<br>
we then, forsooth, be raised again,<br>
48. And also our forefathers?<br>
49. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Lo! those of old and those of later time<br>
50. Will all be brought together to the tryst of an appointed day.<br>
51. Then lo! ye, the erring, the deniers,<br>
52. Ye verily will eat of a tree called Zaqqum<br>
53. And will fill your bellies therewith;<br>
54. And thereon ye will drink of boiling water,<br>
55. Drinking even as the camel drinketh.<br>
56. This will be their welcome on the Day of Judgment.<br>
57. We created you. Will ye then admit the truth?<br>
58. Have ye seen that which ye emit?<br>
59. Do ye create it or are We the Creator?<br>
60. We mete out death among you, and We are not to be outrun,<br>
61. That We may transfigure you and make you what ye know not.<br>
62. And verily ye know the first creation. Why, then, do ye not reflect?<br>
63. Have ye seen that which ye cultivate?<br>
64. Is it ye who foster it, or are We the Fosterer?<br>
65. If We willed, We verily could make it chaff, then would ye cease not to<br>
exclaim:<br>
66. Lo! we are laden with debt!<br>
67. Nay, but we are deprived!<br>
<br>
263<br>
<br>
68. Have ye observed the water which ye drink?<br>
69. Is it ye who shed it from the raincloud, or are We the Shedder?<br>
70. If We willed We verily could make it bitter. Why then, give ye not thanks?<br>
71. Have ye observed the fire which ye strike out;<br>
72. Was it ye who made the tree thereof to grow, or were We the grower?<br>
73. We, even We, appointed it a memorial and a comfort for the dwellers in the<br>
wilderness.<br>
74. Therefor [O Muhammad], praise the name of thy Lord, the Tremendous.<br>
75. Nay, I swear by the places of the stars 76. And lo! that verily is a tremendous oath, if ye but knew 77. That [this] is indeed a noble Qur'an<br>
78. In a Book kept hidden<br>
79. Which none toucheth save the purified,<br>
80. A revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.<br>
81. Is it this Statement that ye scorn,<br>
82. And make denial thereof your livelihood?<br>
83. Why, then, when [the soul] cometh up to the throat [of the dying]<br>
84. And ye are at that moment looking<br>
85. - And We are nearer unto him than ye are, but ye see not 86. Why then, if ye are not in bondage [unto Us],<br>
87. Do ye not force it back, if ye are truthful?<br>
88. Thus if he is of those brought nigh,<br>
89. Then breath of life, and plenty, and a Garden of delight.<br>
90. And if he is of those on the right hand,<br>
91. Then [the greeting] "Peace be unto thee" from those on the right hand.<br>
92. But if he is of the rejecters, the erring,<br>
93. Then the welcome will be boiling water<br>
94. And roasting at hell-fire.<br>
95. Lo! this is certain truth.<br>
96. Therefor [O Muhammad] praise the name of thy Lord, the Tremendous.<br>

SURA 57. AL-HADID (THE IRON)<br>
1. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifieth Allah; and He is the<br>
Mighty, the Wise.<br>
2. His is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; He quickeneth and He<br>
giveth death; and He is Able to do all things.<br>
3. He is the First and the Last, and the Outward and the Inward; and He is<br>
Knower of all things.<br>
<br>
264<br>
<br>
4. He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days; then He mounted<br>
the Throne. He knoweth all that entereth the earth and all that emergeth<br>
therefrom and all that cometh down from the sky and all that ascendeth therein;<br>
and He is with you wheresoever ye may be. And Allah is Seer of what ye do.<br>
5. His is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and unto Allah [all]<br>
things are brought back.<br>
6. He causeth the night to pass into the day, and He causeth the day to pass<br>
into the night, and He is knower of all that is in the breasts.<br>
7. Believe in Allah and His messenger, and spend of that whereof He hath made<br>
you trustees; and such of you as believe and spend [aright], theirs will be a<br>
great reward.<br>
8. What aileth you that ye believe not in Allah, when the messenger calleth you<br>
to believe in your Lord, and He hath already made a covenant with you, if ye are<br>
believers?<br>
9. He it is Who sendeth down clear revelations unto His slave, that He may bring<br>
you forth from darkness unto light; and lo! for you, Allah is Full of Pity,<br>
Merciful.<br>
10. And what aileth you that ye spend not in the way of Allah when unto Allah<br>
belongeth the inheritance of the heavens and the earth? Those who spent and<br>
fought before the victory are not upon a level [with the rest of you]. Such are<br>
greater in rank than those who spent and fought afterwards. Unto each hath Allah<br>
promised good. And Allah is Informed of what ye do.<br>
11. Who is he that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan, that He may double it for<br>
him and his may be a rich reward?<br>
12. On the day when thou [Muhammad] wilt see the believers, men and women, their<br>
light shining forth before them and on their right hands, [and wilt hear it said<br>
unto them]: Glad news for you this day: Gardens underneath which rivers flow,<br>
wherein ye are immortal. That is the supreme triumph.<br>
13. On the day when the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women will say<br>
unto those who believe: Look on us that we may borrow from your light! it will<br>
be said: Go back and seek for light! Then there will separate them a wall<br>
wherein is a gate, the inner side whereof containeth mercy, while the outer side<br>
thereof is toward the doom.<br>
14. They will cry unto them [saying]: Were we not with you? They will say: Yea,<br>
verily; but ye tempted one another, and hesitated, and doubted, and vain desires<br>
beguiled you till the ordinance of Allah came to pass; and the deceiver deceived<br>
you concerning Allah;<br>
15. So this day no ransom can be taken from you nor from those who disbelieved.<br>
Your home is the Fire; that is your patron, and a hapless journey's end.<br>
16. Is not the time ripe for the hearts<br>
Allah's reminder and to the truth which<br>
those who received the scripture of old<br>
so their hearts were hardened, and many<br>
<br>
of those who believe to submit to<br>
is revealed, that they become not as<br>
but the term was prolonged for them and<br>
of them are evil-livers.<br>
<br>
17. Know that Allah quickeneth the earth after its death. We have made clear Our<br>
revelations for you, that haply ye may understand.<br>
18. Lo! those who give alms, both men and women, and lend unto Allah a goodly<br>
loan, it will be doubled for them, and theirs will be a rich reward.<br>
19. And those who believe in Allah and His messengers, they are the loyal, and<br>
the martyrs are with their Lord; they have their reward and their light; while<br>
265<br>
<br>
as for those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, they are owners of hellfire.<br>
20. Know that the life of the world is only play, and idle talk, and pageantry,<br>
and boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children; as the<br>
likeness of vegetation after rain, whereof the growth is pleasing to the<br>
husbandman, but afterward it drieth up and thou seest it turning yellow, then it<br>
becometh straw. And in the Hereafter there is grievous punishment, and [also]<br>
forgiveness from Allah and His good pleasure, whereas the life of the world is<br>
but matter of illusion.<br>
21. Race one with another for forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whereof<br>
the breadth is as the breadth of the heavens and the earth, which is in store<br>
for those who believe in Allah and His messengers. Such is the bounty of Allah,<br>
which He bestoweth upon whom He will, and Allah is of Infinite Bounty.<br>
22. Naught of disaster befalleth in the earth or in yourselves but it is in a<br>
Book before we bring it into being - Lo! that is easy for Allah 23. That ye grieve not for the sake of that which hath escaped you, nor yet<br>
exult because of that which hath been given. Allah loveth not all prideful<br>
boasters,<br>
24. Who hoard and who enjoin upon the people avarice. And whosoever turneth<br>
away, still Allah is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise.<br>
25. We verily sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the<br>
Scripture and the Balance, that mankind may observe right measure; and He<br>
revealed iron, wherein is mighty power and [many] uses for mankind, and that<br>
Allah may know him who helpeth Him and His messengers, though unseen. Lo! Allah<br>
is Strong, Almighty.<br>
26. And We verily sent Noah and Abraham and placed the prophethood and the<br>
scripture among their seed, and among them there is he who goeth right, but many<br>
of them are evil-livers.<br>
27. Then We caused Our messengers to follow in their footsteps; and We caused<br>
Jesus, son of Mary, to follow, and gave him the Gospel, and placed compassion<br>
and mercy in the hearts of those who followed him. But monasticism they invented<br>
- We ordained it not for them - only seeking Allah's pleasure, and they observed<br>
it not with right observance. So We give those of them who believe their reward,<br>
but many of them are evil-livers.<br>
28. O ye who believe! Be mindful of your duty to Allah and put faith in His<br>
messenger. He will give you twofold of His mercy and will appoint for you a<br>
light wherein ye shall walk, and will forgive you. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful;<br>
29. That the People of the Scripture may know that they control naught of the<br>
bounty of Allah, but that the bounty is in Allah's hand to give to whom He will.<br>
And Allah is of Infinite Bounty.<br>
<br>
SURA 58. AL-MUJADILA (SHE THAT DISPUTETH, THE<br>
PLEADING WOMAN)<br>
1. Allah hath heard the saying of her that disputeth with thee [Muhammad]<br>
concerning her husband, and complaineth unto Allah. And Allah heareth your<br>
colloquy. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower.<br>
<br>
266<br>
<br>
2. Such of you as put away your wives [by saying they are as their mothers] They are not their mothers; none are their mothers except those who gave them<br>
birth - they indeed utter an ill word and a lie. And lo! Allah is Forgiving,<br>
Merciful.<br>
3. Those who put away their wives [by saying they are as their mothers] and<br>
afterward would go back on that which they have said, [the penalty] in that case<br>
[is] the freeing of a slave before they touch one another. Unto this ye are<br>
exhorted; and Allah is Informed of what ye do.<br>
4. And he who findeth not [the wherewithal], let him fast for two successive<br>
months before they touch one another; and for him who is unable to do so [the<br>
penance is] the feeding of sixty needy ones. This, that ye may put trust in<br>
Allah and His messenger. Such are the limits [imposed by Allah]; and for<br>
disbelievers is a painful doom.<br>
5. Lo! those who oppose Allah and His messenger will be abased even as those<br>
before them were abased; and We have sent down clear tokens, and for<br>
disbelievers is a shameful doom<br>
6. On the day when Allah will raise them all together and inform them of what<br>
they did. Allah hath kept account of it while they forgot it. And Allah is<br>
Witness over all things.<br>
7. Hast thou not seen that Allah knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that<br>
is in the earth? There is no secret conference of three but He is their fourth,<br>
nor of five but He is their sixth, nor of less than that or more but He is with<br>
them wheresoever they may be; and afterward, on the Day of Resurrection, He will<br>
inform them of what they did. Lo! Allah is Knower of all things.<br>
8. Hast thou not observed those who were forbidden conspiracy and afterward<br>
returned to that which they had been forbidden, and [now] conspire together for<br>
crime and wrongdoing and disobedience toward the messenger? And when they come<br>
unto thee they greet thee with a greeting wherewith Allah greeteth thee not, and<br>
say within themselves: Why should Allah punish us for what we say? Hell will<br>
suffice them; they will feel the heat thereof - a hapless journey's end!<br>
9. O ye who believe! When ye conspire together, conspire not together for crime<br>
and wrongdoing and disobedience toward the messenger, but conspire together for<br>
righteousness and piety, and keep your duty toward Allah, unto whom ye will be<br>
gathered.<br>
10. Lo! Conspiracy is only of the devil, that he may vex those who believe; but<br>
he can harm them not at all unless by Allah's leave. In Allah let believers put<br>
their trust.<br>
11. O ye who believe! when it is said unto you, Make room! in assemblies, then<br>
make room; Allah will make way for you [hereafter]. And when it is said, Come up<br>
higher! go up higher; Allah will exalt those who believe among you, and those<br>
who have knowledge, to high ranks. Allah is Informed of what ye do.<br>
12. O ye who believe! When ye hold conference with the messenger, offer an alms<br>
before your conference. That is better and purer for you. But if ye cannot find<br>
[the wherewithal] then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
13. Fear ye to offer alms before your conference? Then, when ye do it not and<br>
Allah hath forgiven you, establish worship and pay the poor-due and obey Allah<br>
and His messenger. And Allah is Aware of what ye do.<br>
14. Hast thou not seen those who take for friends a folk with whom Allah is<br>
wroth? They are neither of you nor of them, and they swear a false oath<br>
knowingly.<br>
<br>
267<br>
<br>
15. Allah hath prepared for them a dreadful doom. Evil indeed is that which they<br>
are wont to do.<br>
16. They make a shelter of their oaths and turn [men] from the way of Allah; so<br>
theirs will be a shameful doom.<br>
17. Their wealth and their children will avail them naught against Allah. Such<br>
are rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein.<br>
18. On the day when Allah will raise them all together, then will they swear<br>
unto Him as they [now] swear unto you, and they will fancy that they have some<br>
standing. Lo! is it not they who are the liars?<br>
19. The devil hath engrossed them and so hath caused them to forget remembrance<br>
of Allah. They are the devil's party. Lo! is it not the devil's party who will<br>
be the losers?<br>
20. Lo! those who oppose Allah and His messenger, they will be among the lowest.<br>
21. Allah hath decreed: Lo! I verily shall conquer, I and My messengers. Lo!<br>
Allah is Strong, Almighty.<br>
22. Thou wilt not find folk who believe in Allah and the Last Day loving those<br>
who oppose Allah and His messenger, even though they be their fathers or their<br>
sons or their brethren or their clan. As for such, He hath written faith upon<br>
their hearts and hath strengthened them with a Spirit from Him, and He will<br>
bring them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide.<br>
Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him. They are<br>
Allah's party. Lo! is it not Allah's party who are the successful?<br>
<br>
SURA 59. AL-HASHR (EXILE, BANISHMENT)<br>
1. All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah, and<br>
He is the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
2. He it is Who hath caused those of the People of the Scripture who disbelieved<br>
to go forth from their homes unto the first exile. Ye deemed not that they would<br>
go forth, while they deemed that their strongholds would protect them from<br>
Allah. But Allah reached them from a place whereof they recked not, and cast<br>
terror in their hearts so that they ruined their houses with their own hands and<br>
the hands of the believers. So learn a lesson, O ye who have eyes!<br>
3. And if Allah had not decreed migration for them, He verily would have<br>
punished them in the world, and theirs in the Hereafter is the punishment of the<br>
Fire.<br>
4. That is because they were opposed to Allah and His messenger; and whoso is<br>
opposed to Allah, [for him] verily Allah is stern in reprisal.<br>
5. Whatsoever palm-trees ye cut down or left standing on their roots, it was by<br>
Allah's leave, in order that He might confound the evil-livers.<br>
6. And that which Allah gave as spoil unto His messenger from them, ye urged not<br>
any horse or riding-camel for the sake thereof, but Allah giveth His messenger<br>
lordship over whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things.<br>
7. That which Allah giveth as spoil unto His messenger from the people of the<br>
townships, it is for Allah and His messenger and for the near of kin and the<br>
orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, that it become not a commodity between<br>
the rich among you. And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And<br>
whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain [from it]. And keep your duty to Allah. Lo!<br>
Allah is stern in reprisal.<br>
<br>
268<br>
<br>
8. And [it is] for the poor fugitives who have been driven out from their homes<br>
and their belongings, who seek bounty from Allah and help Allah and His<br>
messenger. They are the loyal.<br>
9. Those who entered the city and the faith before them love those who<br>
them for refuge, and find in their breasts no need for that which hath<br>
given them, but prefer [the fugitives] above themselves though poverty<br>
their lot. And whoso is saved from his own avarice - such are they who<br>
successful.<br>
<br>
flee unto<br>
been<br>
become<br>
are<br>
<br>
10. And those who came [into the faith] after them say: Our Lord! Forgive us and<br>
our brethren who were before us in the faith, and place not in our hearts any<br>
rancour toward those who believe. Our Lord! Thou art Full of Pity, Merciful.<br>
11. Hast thou not observed those who are hypocrites, [how] they tell their<br>
brethren who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture: If ye are driven out,<br>
we surely will go out with you, and we will never obey anyone against you, and<br>
if ye are attacked we verily will help you. And Allah beareth witness that they<br>
verily are liars.<br>
12. [For] indeed if they are driven out they go not out with them, and indeed if<br>
they are attacked they help them not, and indeed if they had helped them they<br>
would have turned and fled, and then they would not have been victorious.<br>
13. Ye are more awful as a fear in their bosoms than Allah. That is because they<br>
are a folk who understand not.<br>
14. They will not fight against you in a body save in fortified villages or from<br>
behind walls. Their adversity among themselves is very great. Ye think of them<br>
as a whole whereas their hearts are divers. That is because they are a folk who<br>
have no sense.<br>
15. On the likeness of those [who suffered] a short time before them, they taste<br>
the ill-effects of their own conduct, and theirs is painful punishment.<br>
16. [And the hypocrites are] on the likeness of the devil when he telleth man to<br>
disbelieve, then, when he disbelieveth saith: Lo! I am quit of thee. Lo! I fear<br>
Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.<br>
17. And the consequence for both will be that they are in the Fire, therein<br>
abiding. Such is the reward of evil-doers.<br>
18. O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah. And let every soul look to<br>
that which it sendeth on before for the morrow. And observe your duty to Allah.<br>
Lo! Allah is Informed of what ye do.<br>
19. And be not ye as those who forgot Allah, therefor He caused them to forget<br>
their souls. Such are the evil-doers.<br>
20. Not equal are the owners of the Fire and the owners of the Garden. The<br>
owners of the Garden, they are the victorious.<br>
21. If We had caused this Qur'an to descend upon a mountain, thou [O Muhammad]<br>
verily hadst seen it humbled, rent asunder by the fear of Allah. Such<br>
similitudes coin We for mankind that haply they may reflect.<br>
22. He is Allah, than Whom there is no other Allah, the Knower of the Invisible<br>
and the Visible. He is the Beneficent, Merciful.<br>
23. He is Allah, than Whom there is no other Allah, the Sovereign Lord, the Holy<br>
One, Peace, the Keeper of Faith, the Guardian, the Majestic, the Compeller, the<br>
Superb. Glorified be Allah from all that they ascribe as partner [unto Him].<br>
<br>
269<br>
<br>
24. He is Allah, the Creator, the Shaper out of naught, the Fashioner. His are<br>
the most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifieth<br>
Him, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
<br>
SURA 60. AL-MUMTAHINA (SHE THAT IS TO BE EXAMINED,<br>
EXAMINING HER)<br>
1. O ye who believe! Choose not My enemy and your enemy for allies. Do ye give<br>
them friendship when they disbelieve in that truth which hath come unto you,<br>
driving out the messenger and you because ye believe in Allah, your Lord? If ye<br>
have come forth to strive in My way and seeking My good pleasure, [show them not<br>
friendship]. Do ye show friendship unto them in secret, when I am Best Aware of<br>
what ye hide and what ye proclaim? And whosoever doeth it among you, he verily<br>
hath strayed from the right way.<br>
2. If they have the upper hand of you, they will be your foes, and will stretch<br>
out their hands and their tongues toward you with evil [intent], and they long<br>
for you to disbelieve.<br>
3. Your ties of kindred and your children will avail you naught upon the Day of<br>
Resurrection. He will part you. Allah is Seer of what ye do.<br>
4. There is a goodly pattern for you in Abraham and those with him, when they<br>
told their folk: Lo! we are guiltless of you and all that ye worship beside<br>
Allah. We have done with you. And there hath arisen between us and you hostility<br>
and hate for ever until ye believe in Allah only - save that which Abraham<br>
promised his father [when he said]: I will ask forgiveness for thee, though I<br>
own nothing for thee from Allah - Our Lord! In Thee we put our trust, and unto<br>
Thee we turn repentant, and unto Thee is the journeying.<br>
5. Our Lord! Make us not a prey for those who disbelieve, and forgive us, our<br>
Lord! Lo! Thou, only Thou, are the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
6. Verily ye have in them a goodly pattern for everyone who looketh to Allah and<br>
the Last Day. And whosoever may turn away, lo! still Allah, He is the Absolute,<br>
the Owner of Praise.<br>
7. It may be that Allah will ordain love between you and those of them with whom<br>
ye are at enmity. Allah is Mighty, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
8. Allah forbiddeth you not those who warred not against you on account of<br>
religion and drove you not out from your homes, that ye should show them<br>
kindness and deal justly with them. Lo! Allah loveth the just dealers.<br>
9. Allah forbiddeth you only those who warred against you on account of religion<br>
and have driven you out from your homes and helped to drive you out, that ye<br>
make friends of them. Whosoever maketh friends of them - [All] such are wrongdoers.<br>
10. O ye who believe! When believing women come unto you as fugitives, examine<br>
them. Allah is Best Aware of their faith. Then, if ye know them for true<br>
believers, send them not back unto the disbelievers. They are not lawful for<br>
them [the disbelievers], nor are they [the disbelievers] lawful for them. And<br>
give them [the disbelievers] that which they have spent [upon them]. And it is<br>
no sin for you to marry such women when ye have given them their dues. And hold<br>
not to the ties of disbelieving women; and ask for [the return of] that which ye<br>
have spent; and let them [the disbelievers] ask for that which they have spent.<br>
That is the judgment of Allah. He judgeth between you. Allah is Knower, Wise.<br>
<br>
270<br>
<br>
11. And if any of your wives have gone from you unto the disbelievers and<br>
afterward ye have your turn [of triumph], then give unto those whose wives have<br>
gone the like of that which they have spent, and keep your duty to Allah in Whom<br>
ye are believers.<br>
12. O Prophet! If believing women come unto thee, taking oath of allegiance unto<br>
thee that they will ascribe no thing as partner unto Allah, and will neither<br>
steal nor commit adultery nor kill their children, nor produce any lie that they<br>
have devised between their hands and feet, nor disobey thee in what is right,<br>
then accept their allegiance and ask Allah to forgive them. Lo! Allah is<br>
Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
13. O ye who believe! Be not friendly with a folk with whom Allah is wroth, [a<br>
folk] who have despaired of the Hereafter as the disbelievers despair of those<br>
who are in the graves.<br>
<br>
SURA 61. AS-SAFF (THE RANKS, BATTLE ARRAY)<br>
1. All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah, and<br>
He is the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
2. O ye who believe! Why say ye that which ye do not?<br>
3. It is most hateful in the sight of Allah that ye say that which ye do not.<br>
4. Lo! Allah loveth them who battle for His cause in ranks, as if they were a<br>
solid structure.<br>
5. And [remember] when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Why persecute ye<br>
me, when ye well know that I am Allah's messenger unto you? So when they went<br>
astray Allah sent their hearts astray. And Allah guideth not the evil-living<br>
folk.<br>
6. And when Jesus son of Mary said: O Children of Israel! Lo! I am the messenger<br>
of Allah unto you, confirming that which was [revealed] before me in the Torah,<br>
and bringing good tidings of a messenger who cometh after me, whose name is the<br>
Praised One. Yet when he hath come unto them with clear proofs, they say: This<br>
is mere magic.<br>
7. And who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah when he<br>
is summoned unto Al-Islam? And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.<br>
8. Fain would they put out the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will<br>
perfect His light however much the disbelievers are averse.<br>
9. He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of<br>
truth, that He may make it conqueror of all religion however much idolaters may<br>
be averse.<br>
10. O ye who believe! Shall I show you a commerce that will save you from a<br>
painful doom?<br>
11. Ye should believe in Allah and His messenger, and should strive for the<br>
cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is better for you, if ye<br>
did but know.<br>
12. He will forgive you your sins and bring you into Gardens underneath which<br>
rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in Gardens of Eden. That is the supreme<br>
triumph.<br>
13. And [He will give you] another [blessing] which ye love: help from Allah and<br>
present victory. Give good tidings [O Muhammad] to believers.<br>
<br>
271<br>
<br>
14. O ye who believe! Be Allah's helpers, even as Jesus son of Mary said unto<br>
the disciples: Who are my helpers for Allah? They said: We are Allah's helpers.<br>
And a party of the Children of Israel believed, while a party disbelieved. Then<br>
We strengthened those who believed against their foe, and they became the<br>
uppermost.<br>
<br>
SURA 62. AL-JUMUA (THE CONGREGATION, FRIDAY)<br>
1. All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah, the<br>
Sovereign Lord, the Holy One, the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
2. He it is Who hath sent among the unlettered ones a messenger of their own, to<br>
recite unto them His revelations and to make them grow, and to teach them the<br>
Scripture and wisdom, though heretofore they were indeed in error manifest,<br>
3. Along with others of them who have not yet joined them. He is the Mighty, the<br>
Wise.<br>
4. That is the bounty of Allah; which He giveth unto whom He will. Allah is of<br>
Infinite Bounty.<br>
5. The likeness of those who are entrusted with the Law of Moses, yet apply it<br>
not, is as the likeness of the ass carrying books. Wretched is the likeness of<br>
folk who deny the revelations of Allah. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.<br>
6. Say [O Muhammad]: O ye who are Jews! If ye claim that ye are favoured of<br>
Allah apart from [all] mankind, then long for death if ye are truthful.<br>
7. But they will never long for it because of all that their own hands have sent<br>
before, and Allah is Aware of evil-doers.<br>
8. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: Lo! the death from which ye shrink will surely<br>
meet you, and afterward ye will be returned unto the Knower of the Invisible and<br>
the Visible, and He will tell you what ye used to do.<br>
9. O ye who believe! When the call is heard for the prayer of the day of<br>
congregation, haste unto remembrance of Allah and leave your trading. That is<br>
better for you if ye did but know.<br>
10. And when the prayer is ended, then disperse in the land and seek of Allah's<br>
bounty, and remember Allah much, that ye may be successful.<br>
11. But when they spy some merchandise or pastime they break away to it and<br>
leave thee standing. Say: That which Allah hath is better than pastime and than<br>
merchandise, and Allah is the Best of providers.<br>
<br>
SURA 63. AL-MUNAFIQOON (THE HYPOCRITES)<br>
1. When the hypocrites come unto thee [O Muhammad], they say: We bear witness<br>
that thou art indeed Allah's messenger. And Allah knoweth that thou art indeed<br>
His messenger, and Allah beareth witness that the hypocrites indeed are speaking<br>
falsely.<br>
2. They make their faith a pretext so that they may turn [men] from the way of<br>
Allah. Verily evil is that which they are wont to do,<br>
3. That is because they believed, then disbelieved, therefore their hearts are<br>
sealed so that they understand not.<br>
4. And when thou seest them their figures please thee; and if they speak thou<br>
givest ear unto their speech. [They are] as though they were blocks of wood in<br>
<br>
272<br>
<br>
striped cloaks. They deem every shout to be against them. They are the enemy, so<br>
beware of them. Allah confound them! How they are perverted!<br>
5. And when it is said unto them: Come! The messenger of Allah will ask<br>
forgiveness for you! they avert their faces and thou seest them turning away,<br>
disdainful.<br>
6. Whether thou ask forgiveness for them or ask not forgiveness for them is all<br>
one for them; Allah will not forgive them. Lo! Allah guideth not the evil-living<br>
folk.<br>
7. They it is who say: Spend not on behalf of those [who dwell] with Allah's<br>
messenger that they may disperse [and go away from you]; when Allah's are the<br>
treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites comprehend not.<br>
8. They say: Surely, if we return to Al-Madinah the mightier will soon drive out<br>
the weaker; when might belongeth to Allah and to His messenger and to the<br>
believers; but the hypocrites know not.<br>
9. O ye who believe! Let not your wealth nor your children distract you from<br>
remembrance of Allah. Those who do so, they are the losers.<br>
10. And spend of that wherewith We have provided you before death cometh unto<br>
one of you and he saith: My Lord! If only thou wouldst reprieve me for a little<br>
while, then I would give alms and be among the righteous.<br>
11. But Allah reprieveth no soul when its term cometh, and Allah is Informed of<br>
what ye do.<br>
<br>
SURA 64. AT-TAGHABUN (MUTUAL DISILLUSION,<br>
HAGGLING)<br>
1. All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah;<br>
unto Him belongeth Sovereignty and unto Him belongeth praise, and He is Able to<br>
do all things.<br>
2. He it is Who created you, but one of you is a disbeliever and one of you is a<br>
believer, and Allah is Seer of what ye do.<br>
3. He created the heavens and the earth with truth, and He shaped you and made<br>
good your shapes, and unto Him is the journeying.<br>
4. He knoweth all that is in the heavens and the earth, and He knoweth what ye<br>
conceal and what ye publish. And Allah is Aware of what is in the breasts [of<br>
men].<br>
5. Hath not the story reached you of those who disbelieved of old and so did<br>
taste the ill-effects of their conduct, and theirs will be a painful doom.<br>
6. That was because their messengers [from Allah] kept coming unto them with<br>
clear proofs [of Allah's Sovereignty], but they said: Shall mere mortals guide<br>
us? So they disbelieved and turned away, and Allah was independent [of them].<br>
Allah is Absolute, Owner of Praise.<br>
7. Those who disbelieve assert that they will not be raised again. Say [unto<br>
them, O Muhammad]: Yea, verily, by my Lord! ye will be raised again and then ye<br>
will be informed of what ye did; and that is easy for Allah.<br>
8. So believe in Allah and His messenger and the light which We have revealed.<br>
And Allah is Informed of what ye do.<br>
<br>
273<br>
<br>
9. The day when He shall gather you unto the Day of Assembling, that will be a<br>
day of mutual disillusion. And whoso believeth in Allah and doeth right, He will<br>
remit from him his evil deeds and will bring him unto Gardens underneath which<br>
rivers flow, therein to abide for ever. That is the supreme triumph.<br>
10. But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, such are owners of the<br>
Fire; they will abide therein - a hapless journey's end!<br>
11. No calamity befalleth save by Allah's leave. And whosoever believeth in<br>
Allah, He guideth his heart. And Allah is Knower of all things.<br>
12. Obey Allah and obey His messenger; but if ye turn away, then the duty of Our<br>
messenger is only to convey [the message] plainly.<br>
13. Allah! There is no Allah save Him. In Allah, therefore, let believers put<br>
their trust.<br>
14. O ye who believe! Lo! among your wives and your children there are enemies<br>
for you, therefor beware of them. And if ye efface and overlook and forgive,<br>
then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
15. Your wealth and your children are only a temptation, whereas Allah! with Him<br>
is an immense reward.<br>
16. So keep your duty to Allah as best ye can, and listen, and obey, and spend;<br>
that is better for your souls. And whoso is saved from his own greed, such are<br>
the successful.<br>
17. If ye lend unto Allah a goodly loan, He will double it for you and will<br>
forgive you, for Allah is Responsive, Clement,<br>
18. Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
<br>
SURA 65. AT-TALAQ (DIVORCE)<br>
1. O Prophet! When ye [men] put away women, put them away for their [legal]<br>
period and reckon the period, and keep your duty to Allah, your Lord. Expel them<br>
not from their houses nor let them go forth unless they commit open immorality.<br>
Such are the limits [imposed by] Allah; and whoso transgresseth Allah's limits,<br>
he verily wrongeth his soul. Thou knowest not: it may be that Allah will<br>
afterward bring some new thing to pass.<br>
2. Then, when they have reached their term, take them back in kindness or part<br>
from them in kindness, and call to witness two just men among you, and keep your<br>
testimony upright for Allah. Whoso believeth in Allah and the Last Day is<br>
exhorted to act thus. And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, Allah will<br>
appoint a way out for him,<br>
3. And will provide for him from [a quarter] whence he hath no expectation. And<br>
whosoever putteth his trust in Allah, He will suffice him. Lo! Allah bringeth<br>
His command to pass. Allah hath set a measure for all things.<br>
4. And for such of your women as despair of menstruation, if ye doubt, their<br>
period [of waiting] shall be three months, along with those who have it not. And<br>
for those with child, their period shall be till they bring forth their burden.<br>
And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, He maketh his course easy for him.<br>
5. That is the commandment of Allah which He revealeth unto you. And whoso<br>
keepeth his duty to Allah, He will remit from him his evil deeds and magnify<br>
reward for him.<br>
<br>
274<br>
<br>
6. Lodge them where ye dwell, according to your wealth, and harass them not so<br>
as to straiten life for them. And if they are with child, then spend for them<br>
till they bring forth their burden. Then, if they give suck for you, give them<br>
their due payment and consult together in kindness; but if ye make difficulties<br>
for one another, then let some other woman give suck for him [the father of the<br>
child].<br>
7. Let him who hath abundance spend of his abundance, and he whose provision is<br>
measured, let him spend of that which Allah hath given him. Allah asketh naught<br>
of any soul save that which He hath given it. Allah will vouchsafe, after<br>
hardship, ease.<br>
8. And how many a community revolted against the ordinance of its Lord and His<br>
messengers, and We called it to a stern account and punished it with dire<br>
punishment,<br>
9. So that it tasted the ill-effects of its conduct, and the consequence of its<br>
conduct was loss.<br>
10. Allah hath prepared for them stern punishment; so keep your duty to Allah, O<br>
men of understanding! O ye who believe! Now Allah hath sent down unto you a<br>
reminder,<br>
11. A messenger reciting unto you the revelations of Allah made plain, that He<br>
may bring forth those who believe and do good works from darkness unto light.<br>
And whosoever believeth in Allah and doeth right, He will bring him into Gardens<br>
underneath which rivers flow, therein to abide for ever. Allah hath made good<br>
provision for him.<br>
12. Allah it is who hath created seven heavens, and of the earth the like<br>
thereof. The commandment cometh down among them slowly, that ye may know that<br>
Allah is Able to do all things, and that Allah surroundeth all things in<br>
knowledge.<br>
<br>
SURA 66. AT-TAHRIM (BANNING, PROHIBITION)<br>
1. O Prophet! Why bannest thou that which Allah hath made lawful for thee,<br>
seeking to please thy wives? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>
2. Allah hath made lawful for you [Muslims] absolution from your oaths [of such<br>
a kind], and Allah is your Protector. He is the Knower, the Wise.<br>
3. When the Prophet confided a fact unto one of his wives and when she afterward<br>
divulged it and Allah apprised him thereof, he made known [to her] part thereof<br>
and passed over part. And when he told it her she said: Who hath told thee? He<br>
said: The Knower, the Aware hath told me.<br>
4. If ye twain turn unto Allah repentant, [ye have cause to do so] for your<br>
hearts desired [the ban]; and if ye aid one another against him [Muhammad] then<br>
lo! Allah, even He, is his Protecting Friend, and Gabriel and the righteous<br>
among the believers; and furthermore the angels are his helpers.<br>
5. It may happen that his Lord, if he divorce you, will give him in your stead<br>
wives better than you, submissive [to Allah], believing, pious, penitent,<br>
devout, inclined to fasting, widows and maids.<br>
6. O ye who believe! Ward off from yourselves and your families a Fire whereof<br>
the fuel is men and stones, over which are set angels strong, severe, who resist<br>
not Allah in that which He commandeth them, but do that which they are<br>
commanded.<br>
<br>
275<br>
<br>
7. [Then it will be said]: O ye who disbelieve! Make no excuses for yourselves<br>
this day. Ye are only being paid for what ye used to do.<br>
8. O ye who believe! Turn unto Allah in sincere repentance! It may be that your<br>
Lord will remit from you your evil deeds and bring you into Gardens underneath<br>
which rivers flow, on the day when Allah will not abase the Prophet and those<br>
who believe with him. Their light will run before them and on their right hands;<br>
they will say: Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us! Lo! Thou art<br>
Able to do all things.<br>
9. O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern<br>
with them. Hell will be their home, a hapless journey's end.<br>
10. Allah citeth an example for those who disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the<br>
wife of Lot, who were under two of Our righteous slaves yet betrayed them so<br>
that they [the husbands] availed them naught against Allah and it was said [unto<br>
them]: Enter the Fire along with those who enter.<br>
11. And Allah citeth an example for those who believe: the wife of Pharaoh when<br>
she said: My Lord! Build for me a home with thee in the Garden, and deliver me<br>
from Pharaoh and his work, and deliver me from evil-doing folk;<br>
12. And Mary, daughter of 'Imran, whose body was chaste, therefor We breathed<br>
therein something of Our Spirit. And she put faith in the words of her Lord and<br>
His scriptures, and was of the obedient.<br>
<br>
SURA 67. AL-MULK (THE SOVEREIGNTY, CONTROL)<br>

things.<br>
2. Who hath created life and death that He may try you which of you is best in<br>
conduct; and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving,<br>
3. Who hath created seven heavens in harmony. Thou [Muhammad] canst see no fault<br>
in the Beneficent One's creation; then look again: Canst thou see any rifts?<br>
4. Then look again and yet again, thy sight will return unto thee weakened and<br>
made dim.<br>
5. And verily We have beautified the world's heaven with lamps, and We have made<br>
them missiles for the devils, and for them We have prepared the doom of flame.<br>
6. And for those who disbelieve in their Lord there is the doom of hell, a<br>
hapless journey's end!<br>
7. When they are flung therein they hear its roaring as it boileth up,<br>
8. As it would burst with rage. Whenever a [fresh] host is flung therein the<br>
wardens thereof ask them: Came there unto you no warner?<br>
9. They say: Yea, verily, a warner came unto us; but we denied and said: Allah<br>
hath naught revealed; ye are in naught but a great error.<br>
10. And they say: Had we been wont to listen or have sense, we had not been<br>
among the dwellers in the flames.<br>
11. So they acknowledge their sins; but far removed [from mercy] are the<br>
dwellers in the flames.<br>
12. Lo! those who fear their Lord in secret, theirs will be forgiveness and a<br>
great reward.<br>
<br>
276<br>
<br>
13. And keep your opinion secret or proclaim it, lo! He is Knower of all that is<br>
in the breasts [of men].<br>
14. Should He not know what He created? And He is the Subtile, the Aware.<br>
15. He it is Who hath made the earth subservient unto you, so Walk in the paths<br>
thereof and eat of His providence. And unto Him will be the resurrection [of the<br>
dead].<br>
16. Have ye taken security from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not cause<br>
the earth to swallow you when lo! it is convulsed?<br>
17. Or have ye taken security from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not let<br>
loose on you a hurricane? But ye shall know the manner of My warning.<br>
18. And verily those before them denied, then [see] the manner of My wrath [with<br>
them]!<br>
19. Have they not seen the birds above them spreading out their wings and<br>
closing them? Naught upholdeth them save the Beneficent. Lo! He is Seer of all<br>
things.<br>
20. Or who is he that will be an army unto you to help you instead of the<br>
Beneficent? The disbelievers are in naught but illusion.<br>
21. Or who is he that will provide for you if He should withhold His providence?<br>
Nay, but they are set in pride and frowardness.<br>
22. Is he who goeth groping on his face more rightly guided, or he who walketh<br>
upright on a straight road?<br>
23. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: He it is who gave you being, and hath assigned<br>
unto you ears and eyes and hearts. Small thanks give ye!<br>
24. Say: He it is Who multiplieth you in the earth, and unto Whom ye will be<br>
gathered.<br>
25. And they say: When [will] this promise [be fulfilled], if ye are truthful?<br>
26. Say: The knowledge is with Allah only, and I am but a plain warner;<br>
27. But when they see it nigh, the faces of those who disbelieve will be awry,<br>
and it will be said [unto them]: This is that for which ye used to call.<br>
28. Say [O Muhammad]: Have ye thought: Whether Allah causeth me [Muhammad] and<br>
those with me to perish or hath mercy on us, still, who will protect the<br>
disbelievers from a painful doom?<br>
29. Say: He is the Beneficent. In Him we believe and in Him we put our trust.<br>
And ye will soon know who it is that is in error manifest.<br>
30. Say: Have ye thought: If [all] your water were to disappear into the earth,<br>
who then could bring you gushing water?<br>

SURA 68. AL-QALAM (THE PEN)<br>
1. Nun. By the pen and that which they write [therewith],<br>
2. Thou art not, for thy Lord's favour unto thee, a madman.<br>
3. And lo! thine verily will be a reward unfailing.<br>
4. And lo! thou art of a tremendous nature.<br>
5. And thou wilt see and they will see<br>
<br>
277<br>
<br>
6. Which of you is the demented.<br>
7. Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from His way, and He is Best<br>
Aware of those who walk aright.<br>
8. Therefor obey not thou the rejecters<br>
9. Who would have had thee compromise, that they may compromise.<br>
10. Neither obey thou each feeble oath-monger,<br>
11. Detracter, spreader abroad of slanders,<br>
12. Hinderer of the good, transgressor, malefactor<br>
13. Greedy therewithal, intrusive.<br>
14. It is because he is possessed of wealth and children<br>
15. That, when Our revelations are recited unto him, he saith: Mere fables of<br>
the men of old.<br>
16. We shall brand him on the nose.<br>
17. Lo! We have tried them as We tried the owners of the garden when they vowed<br>
that they would pluck its fruit next morning,<br>
18. And made no exception [for the Will of Allah];<br>
19. Then a visitation from thy Lord came upon it while they slept<br>
20. And in the morning it was as if plucked.<br>
21. And they cried out one unto another in the morning,<br>
22. Saying: Run unto your field if ye would pluck [the fruit].<br>
23. So they went off, saying one unto another in low tones:<br>
24. No needy man shall enter it to-day against you.<br>
25. They went betimes, strong in [this] purpose.<br>
26. But when they saw it, they said: Lo! we are in error!<br>
27. Nay, but we are desolate!<br>
28. The best among them said: Said I not unto you: Why glorify ye not [Allah]?<br>
29. They said: Glorified be our Lord! Lo! we have been wrong-doers.<br>
30. Then some of them drew near unto others, self-reproaching.<br>
31. They said: Alas for us! In truth we were outrageous.<br>
32. It may be that our Lord will give us better than this in place thereof. Lo!<br>
we beseech our Lord.<br>
33. Such was the punishment. And verily the punishment of the Hereafter is<br>
greater if they did but know.<br>
34. Lo! for those who keep from evil are gardens of bliss with their Lord.<br>
35. Shall We then treat those who have surrendered as We treat the guilty?<br>
36. What aileth you? How foolishly ye judge!<br>
37. Or have ye a scripture wherein ye learn<br>
38. That ye shall indeed have all that ye choose?<br>
<br>
278<br>
<br>
39. Or have ye a covenant on oath from Us that reacheth to the Day of Judgment,<br>
that yours shall be all that ye ordain?<br>
40. Ask them [O Muhammad] which of them will vouch for that!<br>
41. Or have they other gods? Then let them bring their other gods if they are<br>
truthful<br>
42. On the day when it befalleth in earnest, and they are ordered to prostrate<br>
themselves but are not able,<br>
43. With eyes downcast, abasement stupefying them. And they had been summoned to<br>
prostrate themselves while they were yet unhurt.<br>
44. Leave Me [to deal] with those who give the lie to this pronouncement. We<br>
shall lead them on by steps from whence they know not.<br>
45. Yet I bear with them, for lo! My scheme is firm.<br>
46. Or dost thou [Muhammad] ask a fee from them so that they are heavily taxed?<br>
47. Or is the Unseen theirs that they can write [thereof]?<br>
48. But wait thou for thy Lord's decree, and be not like him of the fish, who<br>
cried out in despair.<br>
49. Had it not been that favour from his Lord had reached him he surely had been<br>
cast into the wilderness while he was reprobate.<br>
50. But his Lord chose him and placed him among the righteous.<br>
51. And lo! those who disbelieve would fain disconcert thee with their eyes when<br>
they hear the Reminder, and they say: Lo! he is indeed mad;<br>
52. When it is naught else than a Reminder to creation.<br>
<br>
SURA 69. AL-HAAQQA (THE REALITY)<br>
1. The Reality!<br>
2. What is the Reality?<br>
3. Ah, what will convey unto thee what the reality is!<br>
4. [The tribes of] Thamud and A'ad disbelieved in the judgment to come.<br>
5. As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the lightning.<br>
6. And as for A'ad, they were destroyed by a fierce roaring wind,<br>
7. Which He imposed on them for seven long nights and eight long days so that<br>
thou mightest have seen men lying overthrown, as they were hollow trunks of<br>
palm-trees.<br>
8. Canst thou [O Muhammad] see any remnant of them?<br>
9. And Pharaoh and those before him, and the communities that were destroyed,<br>
brought error,<br>
10. And they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, therefor did He grip them<br>
with a tightening grip.<br>
11. Lo! when the waters rose, We carried you upon the ship<br>
12. That We might make it a memorial for you, and that remembering ears [that<br>
heard the story] might remember.<br>
<br>
279<br>
<br>
13. And when the trumpet shall sound one blast<br>
14. And the earth with the mountains shall be lifted up and crushed with one<br>
crash,<br>
15. Then, on that day will the Event befall.<br>
16. And the heaven will split asunder, for that day it will be frail.<br>
17. And the angels will be on the sides thereof, and eight will uphold the<br>
Throne of thy Lord that day, above them.<br>
18. On that day ye will be exposed; not a secret of you will be hidden.<br>
19. Then, as for him who is given his record in his right hand, he will say:<br>
Take, read my book!<br>
20. Surely I knew that I should have to meet my reckoning.<br>
21. Then he will be in blissful state<br>
22. In a high garden<br>
23. Whereof the clusters are in easy reach.<br>
24. [And it will be said unto those therein]: Eat and drink at ease for that<br>
which ye sent on before you in past days.<br>
25. But as for him who is given his record in his left hand, he will say: Oh,<br>
would that I had not been given my book<br>
26. And knew not what my reckoning!<br>
27. Oh, would that it had been death!<br>
28. My wealth hath not availed me,<br>
29. My power hath gone from me.<br>
30. [It will be said]: Take him and fetter him<br>
31. And then expose him to hell-fire<br>
32. And then insert him in a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits.<br>
33. Lo! He used not to believe in Allah the Tremendous,<br>
34. And urged not on the feeding of the wretched.<br>
35. Therefor hath he no lover here this day,<br>
36. Nor any food save filth<br>
37. Which none but sinners eat.<br>
38. But nay! I swear by all that ye see<br>
39. And all that ye see not<br>
40. That it is indeed the speech of an illustrious messenger.<br>
41. It is not poet's speech - little is it that ye believe!<br>
42. Nor diviner's speech - little is it that ye remember!<br>
43. It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.<br>
44. And if he had invented false sayings concerning Us,<br>
45. We assuredly had taken him by the right hand<br>
46. And then severed his life-artery,<br>
<br>
280<br>
<br>
47. And not one of you could have held Us off from him.<br>
48. And lo! it is a warrant unto those who ward off [evil].<br>
49. And lo! We know that some among you will deny [it].<br>
50. And lo! it is indeed an anguish for the disbelievers.<br>
51. And lo! it is absolute truth.<br>
52. So glorify the name of thy Tremendous Lord.<br>
<br>
SURA 70. AL-MAARIJ (THE ASCENDING STAIRWAYS)<br>
1. A questioner questioned concerning the doom about to fall<br>
2. Upon the disbelievers, which none can repel,<br>
3. From Allah, Lord of the Ascending Stairways<br>
4. [Whereby] the angels and the Spirit ascend unto Him in a Day whereof the span<br>
is fifty thousand years.<br>
5. But be patient [O Muhammad] with a patience fair to see.<br>
6. Lo! they behold it afar off<br>
7. While we behold it nigh:<br>
8. The day when the sky will become as molten copper,<br>
9. And the hills become as flakes of wool,<br>
10. And no familiar friend will ask a question of his friend<br>
11. Though they will be given sight of them. The guilty man will long to be able<br>
to ransom himself from the punishment of that day at the price of his children<br>
12. And his spouse and his brother<br>
13. And his kin that harboured him<br>
14. And all that are in the earth, if then it might deliver him.<br>
15. But nay! for lo! it is the fire of hell<br>
16. Eager to roast;<br>
17. It calleth him who turned and fled [from truth],<br>
18. And hoarded [wealth] and withheld it.<br>
19. Lo! man was created anxious,<br>
20. Fretful when evil befalleth him<br>
21. And, when good befalleth him, grudging;<br>
22. Save worshippers.<br>
23. Who are constant at their worship<br>
24. And in whose wealth there is a right acknowledged<br>
25. For the beggar and the destitute;<br>
26. And those who believe in the Day of Judgment,<br>
27. And those who are fearful of their Lord's doom 28. Lo! the doom of their Lord is that before which none can feel secure 281<br>
<br>
29. And those who preserve their chastity<br>
30. Save with their wives and those whom their right hands possess, for thus<br>
they are not blameworthy;<br>
31. But whoso seeketh more than that, those are they who are transgressors;<br>
32. And those who keep their pledges and their covenant,<br>
33. And those who stand by their testimony<br>
34. And those who are attentive at their worship.<br>
35. These will dwell in Gardens, honoured.<br>
36. What aileth those who disbelieve, that they keep staring toward thee [O<br>
Muhammad], open-eyed,<br>
37. On the right and on the left, in groups?<br>
38. Doth every man among them hope to enter the Garden of Delight?<br>
39. Nay, verily. Lo! We created them from what they know.<br>
40. But nay! I swear by the Lord of the rising-places and the setting-places of<br>
the planets that We verily are Able<br>
41. To replace them by [others] better than them. And we are not to be outrun.<br>
42. So let them chat and play until they meet their Day which they are promised,<br>
43. The day when they come forth from the graves in haste, as racing to a goal,<br>
44. With eyes aghast, abasement stupefying them: Such is the Day which they are<br>
promised.<br>
<br>
SURA 71. NOOH (NOOH)<br>
1. Lo! We sent Noah unto his people [saying]: Warn thy people ere the painful<br>
doom come unto them.<br>
2. He said: O my people! Lo! I am a plain warner unto you<br>
3. [Bidding you]: Serve Allah and keep your duty unto Him and obey me,<br>
4. That He may forgive you somewhat of your sins and respite you to an appointed<br>
term. Lo! the term of Allah, when it cometh, cannot be delayed, if ye but knew.<br>
5. He said: My Lord! Lo! I have called unto my people night and day<br>
6. But all my calling doth but add to their repugnance;<br>
7. And lo! whenever I call unto them that Thou mayst pardon them they thrust<br>
their fingers in their ears and cover themselves with their garments and persist<br>
[in their refusal] and magnify themselves in pride.<br>
8. And lo! I have called unto them aloud,<br>
9. And lo! I have made public proclamation unto them, and I have appealed to<br>
them in private.<br>
10. And I have said: Seek pardon of your Lord. Lo! He was ever Forgiving.<br>
11. He will let loose the sky for you in plenteous rain,<br>
12. And will help you with wealth and sons, and will assign unto you Gardens and<br>
will assign unto you rivers.<br>
<br>
282<br>
<br>
13. What aileth you that ye hope not toward Allah for dignity<br>
14. When He created you by [divers] stages?<br>
15. See ye not how Allah hath created seven heavens in harmony,<br>
16. And hath made the moon a light therein, and made the sun a lamp?<br>
17. And Allah hath caused you to grow as a growth from the earth,<br>
18. And afterward He maketh you return thereto, and He will bring you forth<br>
again, a [new] forthbringing.<br>
19. And Allah hath made the earth a wide expanse for you<br>
20. That ye may thread the valley-ways thereof.<br>
21. Noah said: My Lord! Lo! they have disobeyed me and followed one whose wealth<br>
and children increase him in naught save ruin;<br>
22. And they have plotted a mighty plot,<br>
23. And they have said: Forsake not your gods. Forsake not Wadd, nor Suwa', nor<br>
Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr.<br>
24. And they have led many astray, and Thou increasest the wrong-doers in naught<br>
save error.<br>
25. Because of their sins they were drowned, then made to enter a Fire. And they<br>
found they had no helpers in place of Allah.<br>
26. And Noah said: My Lord! Leave not one of the disbelievers in the land.<br>
27. If Thou shouldst leave them, they will mislead Thy slaves and will beget<br>
none save lewd ingrates.<br>
28. My Lord! Forgive me and my parents and him who entereth my house believing,<br>
and believing men and believing women, and increase not the wrong-doers in aught<br>
save ruin.<br>
<br>
SURA 72. AL-JINN (THE JINN)<br>
1. Say [O Muhammad]: It is revealed unto me that a company of the Jinn gave ear,<br>
and they said: Lo! we have heard a marvellous Qur'an,<br>
2. Which guideth unto righteousness, so we believe in it and we ascribe no<br>
partner unto our Lord.<br>
3. And [we believe] that He - exalted be the glory of our Lord! - hath taken<br>
neither wife nor son,<br>
4. And that the foolish one among us used to speak concerning Allah an atrocious<br>
lie.<br>
5. And lo! we had supposed that humankind and jinn would not speak a lie<br>
concerning Allah 6. And indeed [O Muhammad] individuals of humankind used to invoke the<br>
protection of individuals of the jinn, so that they increased them in revolt<br>
against Allah];<br>
7. And indeed they supposed, even as ye suppose, that Allah would not raise<br>
anyone [from the dead] 8. And [the Jinn who had listened to the Qur'an said]: We had sought the heaven<br>
but had found it filled with strong warders and meteors.<br>
<br>
283<br>
<br>
9. And we used to sit on places [high] therein to listen. But he who listeneth<br>
now findeth a flame in wait for him;<br>
10. And we know not whether harm is boded unto all who are in the earth, or<br>
whether their Lord intendeth guidance for them.<br>
11. And among us there are righteous folk and among us there are far from that.<br>
We are sects having different rules.<br>
12. And we know that we cannot escape from Allah in the earth, nor can we escape<br>
by flight.<br>
13. And when we heard the guidance, we believed therein, and whoso believeth in<br>
his Lord, he feareth neither loss nor oppression.<br>
14. And there are among us some who have surrendered [to Allah] and there are<br>
among us some who are unjust. And whoso hath surrendered to Allah, such have<br>
taken the right path purposefully.<br>
15. And as for those who are unjust, they are firewood for hell.<br>
16. If they [the idolaters] tread the right path, We shall give them to drink of<br>
water in abundance<br>
17. That We may test them thereby, and whoso turneth away from the remembrance<br>
of his Lord; He will thrust him into ever-growing torment.<br>
18. And the places of worship are only for Allah, so pray not unto anyone along<br>
with Allah.<br>
19. And when the slave of Allah stood up in prayer to Him, they crowded on him,<br>
almost stifling.<br>
20. Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: I pray unto Allah only, and ascribe unto Him no<br>
partner.<br>
21. Say: Lo! I control not hurt nor benefit for you.<br>
22. Say: Lo! none can protect me from Allah, nor can I find any refuge beside<br>
Him<br>
23. [Mine is] but conveyance [of the Truth] from Allah, and His messages; and<br>
whoso disobeyeth Allah and His messenger, lo! his is fire of hell, wherein such<br>
dwell for ever.<br>
24. Till [the day] when they shall behold that which they are promised [they may<br>
doubt]; but then they will know [for certain] who is weaker in allies and less<br>
in multitude.<br>
25. Say [O Muhammad, unto the disbelievers]: I know not whether that which ye<br>
are promised is nigh, or if my Lord hath set a distant term for it.<br>
26. [He is] the Knower of the Unseen, and He revealeth unto none His secret,<br>
27. Save unto every messenger whom He hath chosen, and then He maketh a guard to<br>
go before him and a guard behind him<br>
28. That He may know that they have indeed conveyed the messages of their Lord.<br>
He surroundeth all their doings, and He keepeth count of all things.<br>

SURA 73. AL-MUZZAMMIL (THE ENSHROUDED ONE, BUNDLED<br>
UP)<br>
1. O thou wrapped up in thy raiment!<br>
2. Keep vigil the night long, save a little 3. A half thereof, or abate a little thereof<br>
4. Or add [a little] thereto - and chant the Qur'an in measure,<br>
5. For we shall charge thee with a word of weight.<br>
6. Lo! the vigil of the night is [a time] when impression is more keen and<br>
speech more certain.<br>
7. Lo! thou hast by day a chain of business.<br>
8. So remember the name of thy Lord and devote thyself with a complete devotion<br>
9. Lord of the East and the West; there is no Allah save Him; so choose thou Him<br>
alone for thy defender 10. And bear with patience what they utter, and part from them with a fair<br>
leave-taking.<br>
11. Leave Me to deal with the deniers, lords of ease and comfort [in this life];<br>
and do thou respite them awhile.<br>
12. Lo! with Us are heavy fetters and a raging fire,<br>
13. And food which choketh [the partaker], and a painful doom<br>
14. On the day when the earth and the hills rock, and the hills become a heap of<br>
running sand.<br>
15. Lo! We have sent unto you a messenger as witness against you, even as We<br>
sent unto Pharaoh a messenger.<br>
16. But Pharaoh rebelled against the messenger, whereupon We seized him with no<br>
gentle grip.<br>
17. Then how, if ye disbelieve, will ye protect yourselves upon the day which<br>
will turn children grey,<br>
18. The very heaven being then rent asunder. His promise is to be fulfilled.<br>
19. Lo! This is a Reminder. Let him who will, then, choose a way unto his Lord.<br>
20. Lo! thy Lord knoweth how thou keepest vigil sometimes nearly two-thirds of<br>
the night, or [sometimes] half or a third thereof, as do a party of those with<br>
thee. Allah measureth the night and the day. He knoweth that ye count it not,<br>
and turneth unto you in mercy. Recite, then, of the Qur'an that which is easy<br>
for you. He knoweth that there are sick folk among you, while others travel in<br>
the land in search of Allah's bounty, and others [still] are fighting for the<br>
cause of Allah. So recite of it that which is easy [for you], and establish<br>
worship and pay the poor-due, and [so] lend unto Allah a goodly loan. Whatsoever<br>
good ye send before you for your souls, ye will find it with Allah, better and<br>
greater in the recompense. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is<br>
Forgiving, Merciful.<br>

2. Arise and warn!<br>
3. Thy Lord magnify,<br>
4. Thy raiment purify,<br>
5. Pollution shun!<br>
6. And show not favour, seeking wordly gain!<br>
7. For the sake of thy Lord, be patient!<br>
8. For when the trumpet shall sound,<br>
9. Surely that day will be a day of anguish,<br>
10. Not of ease, for disbelievers.<br>
11. Leave Me [to deal] with him whom I created lonely,<br>
12. And then bestowed upon him ample means,<br>
13. And sons abiding in his presence<br>
14. And made [life] smooth for him.<br>
15. Yet he desireth that I should give more.<br>
16. Nay! For lo! he hath been stubborn to Our revelations.<br>
17. On him I shall impose a fearful doom.<br>
18. For lo! he did consider; then he planned 19. [Self-]destroyed is he, how he planned!<br>
20. Again [self-]destroyed is he, how he planned! 21. Then looked he,<br>
22. Then frowned he and showed displeasure.<br>
23. Then turned he away in pride<br>
24. And said: This is naught else than magic from of old;<br>
25. This is naught else than speech of mortal man.<br>
26. Him shall I fling unto the burning.<br>
27. - Ah, what will convey unto thee what that burning is! 28. It leaveth naught; it spareth naught<br>
29. It shrivelleth the man.<br>
30. Above it are nineteen.<br>
31. We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and their number<br>
have We made to be a stumbling-block for those who disbelieve; that those to<br>
whom the Scripture hath been given may have certainty, and that believers may<br>
increase in faith; and that those to whom the Scripture hath been given and<br>
believers may not doubt; and that those in whose hearts there is disease, and<br>
<br>
286<br>
<br>
disbelievers, may say: What meaneth Allah by this similitude? Thus Allah sendeth<br>
astray whom He will, and whom He will He guideth. None knoweth the hosts of thy<br>
Lord save Him. This is naught else than a Reminder unto mortals.<br>
32. Nay, by the Moon<br>
33. And the night when it withdraweth<br>
34. And the dawn when it shineth forth,<br>
35. Lo! this is one of the greatest [portents]<br>
36. As a warning unto men,<br>
37. Unto him of you who will advance or hang back.<br>
38. Every soul is a pledge for its own deeds;<br>
39. Save those who will stand on the right hand.<br>
40. In gardens they will ask one another<br>
41. Concerning the guilty:<br>
42. What hath brought you to this burning?<br>
43. They will answer: We were not of those who prayed<br>
44. Nor did we feed the wretched.<br>
45. We used to wade [in vain dispute] with [all] waders,<br>
46. And we used to deny the Day of Judgment,<br>
47. Till the Inevitable came unto us.<br>
48. The mediation of no mediators will avail them then.<br>
49. Why now turn they away from the Admonishment,<br>
50. As they were frightened asses<br>
51. Fleeing from a lion?<br>
52. Nay, but everyone of them desireth that he should be given open pages [from<br>
Allah].<br>
53. Nay, verily. They fear not the Hereafter.<br>
